description: "A collection of Richard W. Dodson's (1915-2008) letters and ephemera to and from Edward Elmer 'Doc' Smith (1890-1965), chemist and pioneer science fiction writer, and other science fiction authors, editors, and friends, including Clark Ashton Smith and Abraham Merritt. Dodson began writing to Smith as a high school student, exchanging letters that ranged from the nature of science fiction writing and critiques of Smith's work to the study of science. Their correspondence spanned almost decades, during which time Dodson grew up to become a prominent atomic scientist."
