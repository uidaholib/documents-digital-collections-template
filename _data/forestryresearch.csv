A Simulation Approach for Predicting the Effect of Douglas-Fir Tussock Moth Defoliation on Juvenile Tree Growth and Stand Dynamics,"Moore, J. A.; Hatch, C.

Franco, and ponderosa pine, Pinus ponderosa Laws., in northern Idaho. Simulated experiments using the model examined the effects of Douglas-fir tussock moth, Orgyia pseudotsugata McDunnough, defoliation on stand dynamics during the first 40 years of stand development. The sequence and intensity of the defoliation episodes were varied for different combinations of age, stand density, and tree species composition at the time of the first defoliation. The results are summarized in statistical models which predict the long-term effects of tussock moth defoliationon stand dynamics. Results indicate that the insect regulates primary forest production by reducing stand biomass and by redistributing growth energy from host to nonhost trees by altering intertree competitive relationships to the advantage of nonhosts.",1981,yes,research (document genres);,"Moore, J.A. and C.R.

Growth and Yield of Leucaena in the Phillippines,"Goudie, J.W.; Moore, J.A.",Empirical yield tables for leucaena plantations in the Phillippines were developed. Site index and height growth equations were developed as components of leucaena growth and yield. The relationships between volume and biomass per ha and top height were quantified. The yield tables and site index equation can be applied in the Phillippines and perhaps other geographic areas where leucaena grows under similar edaphic and management conditions.

Economic Analysis of a Tree Improvent Program for Westerm Larch,"Fins, L.; Moore, J.A.","An individual-tree simulation model called Prognosis and an economic subroutine called CHEAPO were used to determine financial rotation ages (in this analysis defined as the age at which net present value is maximized) for stands grown with genetically improved and unimproved western larch (Larix occidentalis) in north Idaho. Three hypothetical but reasonable growth functions were tested on two site classes. Sensitivity analyses showed that the tree improvement investment was likely to be profitable at 4 and 5 percent discount rates on excellent sites and at 4 percent on good sites. The analysis was most sensitive to changes in discount rate, site quality, and cone production rate. It was moderately sensitive to variation in time to seed production, number of productive orchard years, and differences among the assumed biological functions. As the hypothetical growth functions were designed to be conservative, economic gains are likely to be larger than those indicated in the analysis.",1984-11-01,yes,research (document genres);,"Fins, L. and J.A.

"Fertilization Response by Interior Forests: When, Where, and How Much?","Mika, P.G.; Moore, J.A.; Brockley, R.P.; Powers, R.F.","Interest in tree nutrition and the use of fertilizers in forests of the interior West has grown over the last 20 years. Large-scale fertilizer trials have been established to estimate growth response for Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and lodgepole pine. Current research focuses on where and why fertilizer response is obtained and how fertilization interacts with other forest management activities. Nitrogen is the major growth-limiting nutrient in these forests. For Douglas-fir, gross volume growth responses to 224 kg N /ha may average up to 25% during the first six years following fertilization. Similar treatments in ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine have produced a 30% volume response in five and six years, respectively. Response has been shown to vary across parent materials and soil types; it is usually less on sites with high levels of mineralizable nitrogen in the soil, high foliar nitrogen concentrations, or high site index. Good response to nitrogen fertilization has been linked to vegetation control in very young stands and to stocking control in older stands. Nitrogen fertilization may increase mortality rates and the incidence of pest problems. While other nutrients usually do not produce a significant growth response when applied singly, response to nitrogen may be limited by natural or induced deficiencies of other nutrients. Lack of sulfur, boron, or copper can reduce growth response to nitrogen in lodgepole pine; low potassium levels may have a similar effect in Douglas-fir; and addition of other nutrients, primarily sulfur, has increased response to nitrogen in ponderosa pine.",1992,yes,,"Mika, P.G., J.A.

Beetle-Caused Mortality in Ponderosa Pine: Induced by Nitrogen Fertilization but Prevented by Potassium Amendment,"Mika, P.G.; Moore, J.A.; Mandzak, J.D.","In 1987 six fertilizer trials were established in ponderosa pine stands in western Montana, USA to test if K amendments to N fertilizers could ameliorate increases in tree mortality associated with N fertilization. Treatments were no fertilizer, 225 kg ha-1' of N, or 225 kg ha-1' of both N and K. Foliage samples were collected and analyzed for nutrients one year following treatment and tree heights and diameters were measured at the time of and four years after treatment. Analysis of covariance results showed that fertilization with N alone produced a negative net volume response, but plots receiving both N and K responded positively, producing a highly significant K effect. Treatment differences resulted from heavy tree mortality caused by mountain pine beetle occurring on N treated plots, but not on N+K treated plots. Regression of net volume response on foliar nutrient levels indicated that negative response (beetle mortality) occurred in stands having high initial foliar N concentrations and low K:N ratios.

The shape of the RSG function was linear, convex, or concave depending on initial stand conditions and structure. A recursive system of equations was developed to predict the three coefficients of the RSG function using initial stand density, mean tree size, and coefficient of variation of tree size distribution as predictor variables.

Effects of Intermediate Silvicultural Treatments on the Distribution of Within-Stand Growth,"Moore, J.A.; Zhang, L.; Newberry, J.D.","The distribution of within-stand basal growth following silvicultural treatments was investigated using a relative size -relative growth (RSG) function. The effects of thinning on the distdbution of tree basal area, including changes in location or scale, can be incorporated into the estimation of the RSG function parameters. Additional stand growth due to fertilization can also be allocated to individual trees using the same RSG function, since the contribution of a tree's response to total stand treatment response depends on its relative size in the stand. Statistical tests and validation of the RSG function indicated that thinning and fertilization do not alter the characteristic relationships between tree size, stand density, stand structure, and the relative distribution of growth across size classes within a stand. Therefore, silvicultural treatment growth responses predicted at a whole-stand level of resolution can be disaggregated to a list of individual trees using the RSG function developed from untreated plots.",1993-08-24,,research (document genres); forest management; statistics;,"Moore, J.A., L.

Douglas-fir and Ponderosa Pine Growth and Biochemical Response to Various Multinutrient Fertilizer Treatments,"Shaw, T.M.","Nearly all forest sites in the Inland Northwest are nutrient deficient, usually for nitrogen (N) but sometimes other nutrients as well. Furthermore, a single nutrient limitation cannot always be perceived and there is evidence that shows conifer growth and health may strongly depend on the interaction and availability of several mineral nutrients. In this paper, results are presented from two Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) studies designed to investigate Inland Northwest Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine seedling nutrition as inftuenced by various nutrient treatments.  Results from IFTNC studies have shown that N alone or in conjunction with other mineral nutrient treatments significantly altered foliar nutrient levels, growth rates and carbon allocation patterns in Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine seedlings. As expected, growth was significantly higher for seedlings receiving N amendments than for those seedlings receiving low or no N in the treatment mix. Douglas-fir seedling allocation to needles was the same between the high and low N treatments, but allocation to roots increased while allocation to stem decreased under low N supply.  The effects of the N and potassium (K) treatments on Douglas-fir seedling root production of soluble sugar, starch, phenolic and protein-precipitable tannin were observed in this study. Root storage compounds such as starch were reduced in Douglas-fir seedlings receiving the high N treatments, whereas secondaiy defensive compounds like phenolics and tannins were reduced in plants receiving low K treatments.  Caliper growth in ponderosa pine seedlings grown under different multi-nutrient treatments showed significant differences between application rates, fertilizer release rates, and time of sampling. Seedlings receiving the 15 gram multi-nutrient treatment tended to show higher caliper growth response than seedlings receiving either the 5 or 30 gram treatments. Overall, caliper response after bud set in the fall tended to be higher for those seedlings receiving the medium release rate fertilizer treatment compared to those receiving the slow or fast release rate fertilizers.",1997,yes,research (document genres); fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,"Shaw, T.M., 1997.

Response of Planted Ponderosa Pine Trees to Slow Release Fertilizers,"Fan, Z.; Moore, J.A.","Nutrient availability has long been recognized as a limiting factor to plant growth (Luxmoore et al. 1993). In the Pacific Northwest, of the elements needed for tree growth, nitrogen is the only one that is consistently deficient in the forests of the Northwest (Cole, et al., 1992). Foliage samples collected from 90 fertilizer trials in Douglas-fir scattered across eastern Washington, northeastern Oregon, Idaho and western Montana showed nitrogen concentrations of unfertilized trees to be quite low throughout the area (Mika and Moore, 1990). Foliar analysis has also shown severe to very severe nitrogen deficiencies to be common in lodgepole pine stands throughout the interior of British Columbia (Ballard, 1986) and in many ponderosa pine (Powers et al. 1988) and true fir (Powers, 1981) stands in California and Oregon. No other nutrients have been found generally lacking over such large areas and wide range of conditions. Since early work by the College of Forestry, University of Washington, in the1950's, wide-scale testing with nitrogen has been used to develop response predictions. Currently, however, most information on application rates has been based on broadcast application of soluble nitrogen sources. Very little or no information is available on effects of slow release sources on growth of ponderosa pine, especially using a dibble technique. Therefore, the objectives of this study are:  1) to determine the optimum rate of a complete fertilizer to assure rapid tree establishment and early development during the first four years following outplanting;  2) to evaluate the effects of different nutrient release characteristics on plant performance, especially on the root system and  3) to determine correlation of nutrient concentrations from tissue analysis with nutrient application rate and seedling growth rates.  The experiment, if successful, will provide a practically economic and efficient fertilization method to ensure rapid growth and a higher nutrient uptake rates of after planting ponderosa pine.",1998-04-14,,research (document genres); fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,"Fan, Z., J.A.

Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Forest Foliar Nutrient Analysis Vector Excell,"Shaw, T.M.; Moore, J.A.","Vector analysis is a foliar graphical technique used to compare plant growth, nutrient concentrations and nutrient content. It is a useful diagnostic tool to determine nutritional status of trees in response to silvicultural prescriptions such as forest fertilization. Vector analysis has been used over the past few decades to examine plant responses to various treatments. More recently, the IFTNC has used foliar vector analysis to interpret experimental forest nutrient status and tree growth response.  IFTNC staff, graduate students, and associates developed Vector Excell. Vector Excell was written within Microsoft Excel Visual Basic Editor and runs in a PC (IBM compatible) environment.  This paper covers Vector Excell installation, data entry and operation.

The Effect of Nitrogen Fertilization and Rock Type on Individual Tree Mortality,"Shen, G.; Hatch, C.R.; Moore, J.A.","An individual tree mortality model for nitrogen fertilized Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. gIauca (Beissn.) Franco) stands was developed using data from permanent research plots located throughout the inland Northwest. The proposed linear logistic model included the following independent variables: a set of dummy variables for the 5 rock types, a set of dummy variables for the 3 nitrogen fertilizer treatments, diameter at breast height, crown ratio, number of trees per hectare, and relative rank of tree size, defined by basal area in larger trees over basal area per ha. The results show that nitrogen fertilization and rock type significantly affect individual tree mortality. Trees growing on granitic and meta-sedimentary rocks exhibited greater probabilities of mortality than did those growing on other rocks. The probabilities of mortality for trees growing on sedimentary rocks were very low. The probabilities of tree monality increased with increasing nitrogen fertilizer application rates. Finally, nitrogen fertilization response ratios for annual probability of tree mortality were estimated based on the mortality model. The response ratios were nearly constant (about 1.54) across a range of tree diameters for all rock types with the 224 kg N treatment.

Ponderosa Pine Response to Nitrogen or Nitrogen Plus Potassium Fertilization - Annual Report,"Shaw, T.M.","In 1985, the Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) established 10 nitrogen (N) fertilization trials in stands dominate by Ponderosa pine. The ponderosa pine trials were located throughout northeastern Oregon and central Washington and were an expansion of IFTNC Douglas-fir N fertilization trials established in the early 1980's. The focus of these fertilization trials was to study nutrition of commercial forests in the Intermountain Northwest, with the majority of the effort on studying the effect of N fertilization on growth and survival. In addition, evidence from IFTNC Douglas-fir trials (Mika and Moore 1990) and other research from the Inland Northwest suggested that elements other than N, particularly potassium (K), may also be limiting. In 1987, IFTNC members established 6 additional ponderosa pine trials in Montana to study the effects of N and K fertilization on tree growth and survival.

Root Chemistry of Mature Douglas-fir Differs by Habitat Type in the Interior Northwestern United States,"Moore, J.A.; Mika, P.G.; Shaw, T.M.","Carbon compound concentrations in plant tissues depend on the environment in which plants grow. However, little is known about how these concentrations vary across a range of forest environmental conditions. Our study examined root tissue (phloem, cambium, phellum, and phelloderm) collected from naturally regenerated mature Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca [Bessn.] Franco) trees in eight stands on three habitat type series encompassing a range of temperature and moisture conditions. The objective was to determine root chemical composition (sugar, starch, phenol, and tannin) differences among the habitat types. Douglas-fir roots collected from dry, warm Douglas fir habitat types had sugar concentrations of 4% compared to 3% for roots from cool, moist habitat types. Root samples collected from Douglas-fir habitat types showed tannin concentrations about double those from grand fir or western redcedar habitat types. Phenol/tannin ratios for the cool, moist habitat types were about double those from warm, dry Douglas-fir habitat types. Roots sampled from western redcedar habitat types had phenol concentrations and phenol/sugar ratios more than 50% higher than those from Douglas-fir and grand fir habitat types. We speculate that root chemistry of Douglas-fir growing on Douglas-fir habitat types could make them more drought resistant but less disease resistant, while Douglas-fir growing on western redcedar types would be less drought resistant but more disease resistant.

Four-Year Foliar and Growth Response to Multinutrient Fertilization in Northeast Oregon,"Shaw, T.M.; Moore, J.A.","Results from this study show foliar nutrient deficiencies and multi-nutrient fertilization response for ponderosa pine, grand fir and Douglas-fir over a period of four consecutive growing seasons. Generally, through critical level or vector foliar diagnosis, N, S, B, Cu and possibly Mo were identified as being deficient for all species in this study. Additionally, Douglas-fir on the Noregaard site showed foliar K deficiency response. Distinct foliar nutrient response patterns were observed for those ""strong responding"" nutrients, particularly N and B where foliar response increased, peaked then declined in magnitude relative to the control as the year since fertilization increased. Delayed nutrient response may have been to spring fertilizer application not having manifested itself in time to show strong nutrient response one growing season after fertilization.  Similar to foliar nutrient response, foliar needle weight growth increased, peaked then declined in magnitude relative to the control as the year since fertilization increased. Additionally, needle weight response was delayed due to spring fertilization. Needle weight response was significant for ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir but not for grand fir.  Overall, four-year cubic foot volume response was significantly higher on the multi-nutrient treatment than the controls, with relative gross cubic foot volume response for both sites combined showing a 26.9% increase. Individual site response revealed that much of the combined relative cubic foot volume response was expressed on the Clear Creek site, which showed a 34% increase over the controls while the Noregaard site only showed a 3.9% increase. Periodic relative gross basal area response for both sites combined was greater in the first two-year period (26.9%) than the second two-year period (11.1%).

Two-Year Basal Area Response to Multi-Nutrient Re-fertilization for Douglas-fir in South-Central Washington (Klickitat),"Shaw, T.M.; Moore, J.A.","Six fertilization study sites located in the Klickitat region of south-central Washington were established and fertilized in 1990 and then re-fertilized in 1998. Six-year plot response by treatment from the initial fertilization was analyzed and presented in 1997. Two-year re-fertilization plot response by treatment is presented here in short summary form with a final report to follow after further analysis. A brief introduction with site characteristics (Table1), treatments (Table 2) plot response by treatment tables (Tables 3-6) and vector analysis interpretation and diagnosis (Figures 1) follow this summary.  Two-years after re-fertilization the average gross basal area response overall sites combined was - 3.7%, -3.7% and 0.1% for N, N+S and N+S+Micro applications, respectively (Table 3). In comparison, overall six-year volume response reported by Garrison (1997) was positive but was also poor with 10.3% and 8.4% response on the N and N+K applications, respectively (Table 4). Comparison of geologic parent materials underlying the sites showed that four installations occur on Wanapum basalt, one on Grande Ronde basalt and one on landslide olivine basalt. The Wanapum basalt and olivine basalt responded poorly but the single installation which occurred on a Grande Ronde basalt responded very well, with 30.7%, 36.0% and a significant (p &lt; 0.10) 61.3% for N, N+S and N+S+Micro applications, respectively (Table 5). Similarly, six-year volume response also showed this pattern with sites on Wanapum and olivine basalt  responding poorly (data not shown, Garrison et al, 1997) while Grande Ronde basalt response was good with 35.7% and 30% for the N and N+K applications (Table 6). It appears that all the significant (p &lt; 0.10) positive re-fertilization effect was due to the growth response of the Grande Ronde basalt. Notably, the addition of micro nutrients in the 1998 re-fertilization increased response over the N+S treatment by 25.3%. Notably, other IFTNC sites located on Grande Ronde and Wanapum parent materials show similar response trends. Grande Ronde sites almost always respond well to fertilization while Wanapum sites almost always respond poorly to fertilization.  Vector analysis of foliar response (Shaw and Moore, 1999) also diagnosed Grande Ronde basalt as the best responder to fertilization (Figure 1). Furthermore, vector analysis diagnosed good foliar response for Wanapum and olivine basalts, however, this good foliar response did not translate into good two-year basal area growth response for these two rock types. Perhaps nutrients other than those that were applied in the fertilizer mix were deficient and in-turn reduced response on the Wanapum and olivine basalts. For example, vector analysis identified possible Ca deficiencies for olivine basalt and P deficiencies for Wanapum basalt (Figure 1). Further testing needs to be done to determine the validity of Ca and P deficiencies or other possible growth reducing site factors. Many ""site induced"" confounding factors have complicated the results given in this report.

Understanding the Interactions between Vegetation Control and Fertilization in Young Plantations: Southern Pine Plantations in the Southeast USA,"Allen, H.L.; Albaugh, T.J.","Historically, the practice of silviculture has focussed on controlling the composition, quantity, and structure of forest vegetation and the maintenance of site quality. As forest plantations have become important sources of fiber, fuel, and structural material, this custodial role has given way to active intervention to improve both plant and soil resources. Forest managers are finally recognizing that intensive plantation silviculture is like agronomy; both the plant and the soil need to be actively managed to optimize production. Silvicultural treatments including vegetation control and fertilization can dramatically effect site resource availability and the crop trees' ability to acquire and utilize these resources. The key to optimizing production is to use the best genetic material available and to provide resources in quantities sufficient to allow the trees' genetic potential to be realized. Effective manipulation of the genetic and site resources requires an understanding of what resources limit forest production, how these resources are affected by silvicultural treatment, and how crop trees may differ in their ability to acquire and utilize these resources. Fortunately, our understanding of the physiological and ecological processes regulating forest production has greatly increased during the last decade.  It is now generally accepted that much of the variation in wood production can be accounted for by variation in light interception. (Cannell 1989, Landsberg and Gower 1997, Linder 1987). Light interception is principally a function of the amount of leaf area and the duration of leaf area display. Empirical data from field studies with several conifer and broad-leaved species have shown that leaf area and consequently wood production are below optimum levels (Figure 1, Albaugh et al. 1998, Allen and Albaugh 1999, Benson et al. 1992, Colbert et al. 1990, Pereira et al. 1994, Snowdon and Benson 1992, Vose and Allen 1988). Low nutrient availability is a principal factor causing suboptimal levels of leaf area in many temperate humid areas (Albaugh et al 1998, Colbert et al. 1990). Low soil water availability and high vapor pressure deficits have also been shown to  adversely affect leaf area in areas with growing season water deficits (Benson et al. 1992, Hennessey et al. 1992, Pereira et al. 1994).  The variation in production per unit of leaf area (referred to as growth or leaf area efficiency) can also contribute to the variation in production. Growth efficiency can vary due to differences in photosynthetic efficiency, respiration, and partitioning to various biomass components. Improved nutrient and water availability has been shown to increase photosynthetic efficiency (Linder 1987) and aboveground productivity proportionally more than belowground productivity in stand-level studies (Albaugh et al. 1998, Allen and Albaugh 1999, Gower et al. 1994).",2000-10-18,,research (document genres); forest management;,"Allan, H.L. and T.J.

"Effect of Root Plug Incorporated Controlled-Release Fertilizer upon Two-Year Survival, Growth and Nutrient Status of Planted Ponerosa Pine Seedlings","Fan, Z.; Moore, J.A.; Shafii, B.","Three controlled-release fertilizers (fast release (FR), moderate release (MR) and slow release (SR)) were incorporated in the root plug at rates of0.8, 1.6 or 3.2 grams per seedling at the time of sowing as supplements to nursery supplied soluble fertilizer. Effects on seedling growth, survival and foliar nutrient status of the '160/90' container ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Doug. ex Laws) were evaluated after outplanting. At the end of the second growing season, fertilized seedlings had significantly greater caliper and height than unfertilized seedlings. Fertilization significantly increased relative height growth rate, but did not significantly increase relative caliper growth rate. Most treatments had lower caliper growth rates than the controls. The differences between the 3.2 grams ofMR or SR fertilizer treatments and the controls were statistically significant. Height growth response was attributable to fertilizer doses rather than fertilizer types. The 3.2 grams of MR or SR fertilizer treatments produced significantly higher mortality (55 and 36 %, respectively) than the controls.

"Growth, Biomass Allocation and Root Growth Potential of Container-Grown Ponderosa Pine Seedlings with Controlled-Release Fertilizer Incorporated in the Root Plug","Fan, Z.; Moore, J.A.; Shafii, B.","Prior to sowing seeds, three controlled-release fertilizers (fast release (FR), moderate release (MR) and slow release (SR) were incorporated into the growing media at rates of 0.8, 1.6 or 3.2 grams as supplements to nursery supplied soluble fertilizer to grow ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Doug. ex Laws) seedlings in the greenhouse. At lifting, the caliper, height and total dry weight of fertilized '160/90' seedlings ranged from 114 to 129%, 107 to 121% and 130 to 195% larger than those ofthe unfertilized seedlings, respectively. Needle biomass was affected more than stems or roots by the fertilization treatments. The 0.8 grams ofFR or SR fertilizer treatments significantly increased ponderosa pine seedling root growth potential (RGP) compared to the controls. Toxicity from continuous nutrient release during cold storage resulted in much lower RGP for the 3.2 grams ofMR or SR fertilizer treatments. The best dosage for caliper and height growth was 0.8 grams for FR fertilizer, 2.2 and 2.3 grams for MR fertilizer, and 1.9 and 2.0 grams for SR fertilizer, respectively.

Three IFTNC members were involved in the establishment ofthese study trails. Cooperative members include: Champion Timberlands, Longview Fibre and Washington Dept. ofNatural Resources. The original fertilization trails were designed to study the effects ofnitrogen (N) and potassium (1K) fertilization on tree growth and survival. Tree fertilization response (basal area and cubic volume response over that ofthe controls) was monitored every two years and response results were summarized. Six-year results showed that periodic volume growth response for each two-year period since fertilization gradually decreased over time.

Variation in the Root Bark Chemistry of Douglas-fir,"Myszewski, J.H.; Fins, L.; Moore, J.A.; Rust, M.; Mika, P.G.","Several studies have linked high phenolics:sugar ratios in the inner root bark tissue of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) to decreased susceptibility to Armillaria spp. While these studies have identified environmental factors that influence root chemistry, none have examined whether the phenolics:sugar ratio is genetically controlled. In this study, the effects of genetics and environment on Douglas-fir root bark chemistry were investigated. Significant differences in root bark  chemistry of 15-yr-old Douglas-fir were detected among 20 open-pollinated families and 2 sites in northern Idaho. Family, site and the family x site interaction were significant sources of variation in the concentrations of sugar, starch, protein-precipitable tannins, and phenolics as well as in the phenolics: sugar ratio. Single-tree narrow-sense and family heritability estimates revealed that 20-24% of the variation in the phenolics:sugar ratio can be attributed to genetic differences, while around 60% of the variation in sugar concentrations can be attributed to genetic differences. Family and individual narrow-sense heritability estimates for 12-yr height growth were 0.62 and 0.54, respectively. While the correlation between height and the phenolics:sugar ratio was not significant, three families above the seventieth percentile in height growth expressed above average phenolics: sugar ratios at both sites. Should a high phenolics:sugar ratio prove effective in selecting genotypes for resistance to Armillaria infection, these results suggest that it would be possible to do so without sacrificing families with superior height growth in a tree improvement program. Gains could be made even more efficiently by selecting for low sugar concentrations.",2000-04-01,yes,research (document genres); roots (plant components); trees; statistics;,"Myszewski, J.H., L.

"The Effect of Nitrogen Fertilization, Rock Type, and Habitat Type on Individual Tree Mortality","Shen, G.; Hatch, C.R.; Moore, J.A.","An individual tree mortality model for nitrogen fertilized Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca [Beissn.] Franco) stands was developed using data from permanent research plots located throughout the inland Northwest. The proposed linear logistic model included the following independent variables: a dummy variable for the two habitat types, a set of dummy variables for the five rock types, a set of dummy variables for the three N fertilizer treatments, diameter at breast height, crown ratio, and crown competition factor. The results show that N fertilization, rock type, and habitat type significantly affect individual tree mortality. The probabilities of tree mortality on fertilized plots were greater than those on control plots and increased with increasing N fertilizer application  rates. Trees growing on granitic and metasedimentary rocks had lower foliar potassium concentration and exhibited greater probabilities of mortality than did those growing on other rocks. The probabilities of mortality for trees growing on sedimentary rocks were very low. Moist sites had lower soil fertility and produced higher mortality rates than dry sites. Furthermore, the N fertilization response ratio, defined as the annual mortality probability of a fertilized tree over the annual mortality probability of a unfertilized tree with identical tree and stand characteristics, was estimated based on the mortality model. The response ratios were nearly constant (about 1.4) across a range of tree diameters for all rock types with the 224 kg N treatment. The response ratios were also nearly constant (about 2.1) across a range of tree diameters for all rock types with the 448 kg N treatment.

However, suppressed trees growing on dry sites or on soils derived from granite rocks did not show different relative response than dominant or codominant trees growing in the same stand.

Foliar Nutrient and Tree Growth Response of Mixed-conifer Stands to Three Fertilization Treatments in Northeast Oregon and North Central Washington,"Garrison, M.T.; Moore, J.A.; Shaw, T.M.; Mika, P.G.","The results of two studies evaluating nutrient uptake in mixed-conifer stands following fertilization are reported. The four species examined were Douglas-fir, grand fir, lodgepole pine and ponderosa pine. The fertilization treatments were 224 kg ha-1 nitrogen, 224 kg ha-1 nitrogen plus 112 kg ha-1 sulfur, and 224 kg ha-1 nitrogen plus 190.4 kg ha-1 potassium. Foliar nutrient concentrations, contents and ratios were analyzed, as well as four-year volume response. Douglas-fir showed both N and S deficiencies in control foliage samples, and produced significant growth response to the N + S treatment, but not to the N-alone treatment. Grand fir also showed foliar N and S deficiencies, but produced significant growth response to both N and N + S fertilization. This suggests that grand fir was better able to utilize N than Douglas-fir even under S-limiting conditions. Lodgepole pine showed deficient foliar N and S concentrations, and produced significant volume responses to N and N + K fertilization. Lodgepole volume response to N + S fertilization was highly variable, and appeared to be site specific. Ponderosa pine did not show nutrient deficiencies for N or K, and did not respond significantly in either foliar K or S levels or in growth to N, N + K or N + S fertilization.

Percent canopy covered by understory plant species of three growth forms (shrubs, forbs, grasses) and total understory were determined over a two year period following treatment. Two diversity indices (Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson's index) were used to quantify multi-nutrient fertilization effects on understory plant diversity. Multi-nutrient fertilization prescribed to increase overstory tree growth did not typically reduce understory vegetation diversity, rather diversity increased following fertilization on some sites. Understory composition at the time of treatment greatly determined fertilizalion effects on diversiry as follows: 1) if most species in the plant community responded relatively the same after treatment then diversity was unchanged even though total biomass increase may have been large; 2) if a highly responsive species was abundant prior to treatment. then diversity decreased following fertilization; and 3) if a highly responsive species was relatively rare prior to treatment, then diversity increased following fertilization.

North Idaho Nutrition Guidelines by Rock Type,"Garrison-Johston, M.T.; Moore, J.A.","This document was prepared as a guideline for foresters to use in determining appropriate nutrient management strategies for forest stands on various rock types in north Idaho and portions of northeastern Washington. The guidelines proposed in this document are based on both observational and experimental evidence compiled by the Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) since its inception in 1980.  Nine digital geologic maps covering most of north Idaho and portions of northeastern Washington were compiled for this report. A location map showing the maps used in this compilation is shown in Appendix A. Four of these maps, the Headquarters, Missoula West, Kookia and Hamilton 1:100000 quadrangles, are in preliminary form. Expect the map units to change over time. Stands in these areas MUST be field checked for rock type before proceeding with nutrient management decisions. A listing of all rock units from each of the nine maps was extracted, for a total of approximately 435 rock units. Each of these rock units was assigned to one of 59 lithology groups, labeled as 'LITH_GRP' A complete listing of rock units by map is shown in Appendix D, along with a brief description and the corresponding lithology grouping. Each rock unit was also assigned to one of four broad categories, labeled 'CATEGORY.' These four categories include extrusive/ basaltic rocks, intrusive/ granitic rocks, metamorphic rocks, and mixed rocks.  The following section of the report discusses nutrient management strategies for each rock category. Within each category, the guidelines are further subdivided based on the lithology groupings. These guidelines are based on the current state of knowledge regarding rocks and forest growth. We fully expect these guidelines to be further refined with additional experience and experimentation.  Caveats: Geology maps are a useful tool in forest management. However, the user must be aware that geology maps were not developed for use at the forest stand level. We have found the updated north Idaho geology maps to be very good for giving a general idea of the rocks likely to be found in a particular area, and often the maps are precise to the stand level. Nonetheless, foresters must always verify the rock type in the field before considering fertilization options.

An Analysis of Douglas-fir Beetle Outbreak Occurrence as Related to Geology on the Idaho Panhandle National Forests,"Garrison-Johnston, M.T.; Moore, J.A.; Niehoff, G.","Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) is a native conifer species which is widely distributed throughout the inland northwest of the United States. This species occurs across a variety of site conditions, and may grow in pure stands or in combination with other tree species common to the area. Douglas-fir is one of the most important timber-producing species in the  region.  A number of insects and diseases affect Douglas-fir stands in the region. Most are endemic to the area and experience natural cycles of buildup and decline. During the late 1990's, an endemic insect known as the Douglas-fir beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins) began to increase to epidemic proportions throughout much of northern Idaho and northeastern Washington. This beetle burrows into the tree's bark and lays eggs. The adults and larvae then feed on the phloem, usually girdling and killing the tree (Hagle et al. 1987). During 1996 and 1997, an average of 51 ha/yr (125 ac) were affected by new Douglas-fir beetle attacks. By 1998 approximately 479 ha (1185 ac) were affected, and in 1999, aerial surveys indicated that 31,093 ha (76,830 ac) were impacted. These outbreaks caused great concern, due largely to the increased fire danger caused by huge areas of dead timber. Furthermore, as populations built, the beetles were able to spread further and faster than normal, affecting both public and private timberland in the region. The Panhandle National Forests initiated emergency salvage logging operations in the region, both to reduce fire risk and to reduce the risk of beetles spreading to adjacent private lands.  Recent findings in forest health research have indicated that the bedrock geology underlying forest stands may play an important role in forest nutrition, and consequently may affect tree susceptibility to insects and disease. While direct relationships between rocks and forest stand health have not yet been established, we believe that such relationships exist. In the current study, Forest Service workers in north Idaho and northeastern Washington noted a tendency for Douglas-fir beetle outbreaks to occur more frequently on certain rock types than others, even though adjacent stands on other rock types seemed otherwise very similar. This analysis utilizes Forest Service data on forest vegetative cover and Douglas-fir beetle distribution in combination with geologic data to assess whether beetles favored stands on certain rock types.",2001-04-01,yes,research (document genres); fire prevention; forest management; timber (lumber); wood borers (beetles); geological maps;,"Garrison-Johnston, M.T., J.A.

Three-Year Response of Ponderosa Pine Seedlings to Controlled-Release Fertilizer Applied at Planting,"Fan, Z.; Moore, J.A.; Shafii, B.; Osborne, H.L.","Four controlled-release fertilizers (fast release [FR], moderate release [MR], slow release [SR] and slow release with micronutrients extended [ME]) were applied, at rates of 0, 5, 15 and 30 g/seedling, to ponderosa pine seedlings (Pinus ponderosa Doug. ex Laws) immediately after planting. Compared to the controls, the 5 and15 g/seedling of FR or ME fertilizer produced significantly greater caliper growth and the 5 and 15 g/seedling of ME fertilizer and 15 and 30 g of FR fertilizer produced significantly greater height growth after 3 yr. Mortality occurred mainly during the first growing season and varied substantially with fertilizer types and dosage. High dosage (30 g/seedling) generally caused more mortality than other dosage levels.

Variation in the Root Bark Phenolics/Sugar Ratio of Douglas-fir Grown in Two Plantations in Northern Idaho,"Myszewski, J.H.; Fins, L.; Moore, J.A.; Rust, M.; Mika, P.G.","Several studies have linked high phenolics/sugar ratios in the inner root bark tissue of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) to decreased susceptibility to Armillaria spp. While these studies have identified environmental factors that influence root chemistry, none have examined whether the phenolics/sugar ratio is genetically controlled. In this study, we investigated the effects of genetics and environment on the root bark chemistry of 20 families of 15-year-old Douglas-fir planted in two sites in northern Idaho. Only sugar concentrations varied significantly among families, but site was a significant source of variation for phenolics and the phenolics/sugar ratio.  Family x site interactions were significant for the concentrations of all measured root bark compounds as well as for the phenolics/sugar ratio. Phenotypic correlations between height and the phenolics/sugar ratio and between height and sugar concentrations were not significant. However, families with superior height growth and below-average sugar concentrations could be found at both sites.

Nitrogen Uptake and Turnover in Riparian Woody Vegetation: A 15N Tracer Experiment,"Chambers, C.S.","The nutrient balance of streams and adjacent riparian ecosystems may have been modified by the elimination of anadromous fish runs and perhaps by forest fertilization. To better understand nitrogen dynamics within stream and riparian ecosystems, and the nitrogen transfer between them, we fertilized two streams and their adjacent riparian corridors in central Idaho. On each stream two nitrogen doses were applied to a swathe approximately 35 m wide centered on the stream. The fertilizer N was enriched in 15N to 18%. This enrichment is light relative to many previous labeling studies, yet sufficient to yield a traceable signal in riparian and stream biota. This paper reports pre-treatment differences in ?15N and the first-year N response to fertilizer within the riparian woody plant community. Future manuscripts will describe the transfer of allochthonous litter N to the stream and its subsequent processing by stream biota. Pre-treatment ?15N differed between the two creeks (p = 0.00016), possibly due to residual salmon nitrogen on one of the creeks. Pre-treatment ?15N of current-year needles was enriched compared to leaf litter, which was in turn enriched compared to needles aged 4 years and older. This leads us to conclude that fractionation due to retranslocation occurs in two phases. The first, which optimizes allocation of N in younger needle age classes, is distinctly different from the second, which conserves N prior to abscission. The ?15N difference between creeks was eliminated by the fertilization (p = 0.42). In the two dominant conifer species, Abies lasiocarpa and Picea engelmannii, most fertilizer N was found in the current-year foliage; little was found in older needles and none was detected in litter (p = 0.53). In the only N-fixing shrub species, Alnus incana, little fertilizer N was detected (mean percent N derived from fertilizer (%Ndff) 5.0 ± 1.6% (se)). Far more fertilizer N was taken up by other deciduous shrubs (mean %Ndff = 33.9 ± 4.5%).  Fertilizer N made up 25 (± 4.2%) of the N in deciduous shrub litter. These results demonstrate the importance of pre-treatment measurements, the feasibility of light labeling with 15N, and the potential influence of riparian plant species composition on stream nutrient dynamics via allochthonous leaf litter inputs.",2003-05-01,yes,research (document genres); streams; fertilizer; statistics;,"Chambers, C.S..2003.

Douglas-Fir Beetle Infestations Are Associated with Certain Rock and Stand Types in the Inland Northwestern United States,"Garrison-Johnston, M.T.; Moore, J.A.; Cook, S.P.; Niehoff, G.J.","Landscape-level geographic analysis was used to examine the occurrence of Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) in association with geology (rock type) and forest stand types on the Panhandle National Forests of northern Idaho and northeastern Washington from 1996 to 1999. Beetle infestations occurred most often in mature stands comprised primarily of trees 23 cm in diameter at breast height ( 1.4 m), in habitat types likely to contain Douglas-fir. Douglas-fir stands growing on Prichard and lower Wallace formation metasedimentary rocks and intrusive dikes and sills were signicantly more likely than Douglas-fir stands growing on other rock types to harbor beetle populations during nonoutbreak years early in the study period. By 1999 (when outbreak populations of Douglas-fir beetle were present), beetle infestations occurred across all rock types at rates proportional to the amount ofstand area on those rocks, indicating a decrease in infestation rates for stands on particular rock types when beetle populations were large. Although the biological mechanisms influencing beetle preferences were not examined, information derived in this study could be useful in developing quantitative hazard-rating models for Douglas-fir beetle, and, subsequently, in designing silvicultural practices to reduce the amount of beetle-susceptible Douglas-fir stands on particular rock types.",2003-08-12,,research (document genres); forest management; timber (lumber); wood borers (beetles);,"Garrison-Johnston, M.T., J.A.

Geologic Controls on Tree Nutrition and Forest Health in the Inland Northwest,"Garrison-Johnston, M.T.; Lewis, R.S.; Frost, T.P.","The Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) has been studying forest growth and health throughout the Inland Northwest since the early 1980's. Early fertilization work indicated that while nitrogen (N) was important to tree growth, other elements were important to tree physiological processes and forest health. In particular, potassium (K) appeared to alleviate tree susceptibility to fungal disease and insect attack. To further test this theory, the IFTNC designed an N-and-K fertilization-rate experiment encompassing three vegetation series (an expression of climatic regimes) and four rock types (basalt, granite, glacial deposit, and metasedimentary rock). Of the 36 sites required by the experimental design, only 31 were established because of difficulty in finding suitable, healthy and intact forest stands on metasedimentary rock types. Further examination of the effect of rock on forest growth and health was deemed necessary. With the exception of N and sometimes sulfur, all elements essential for plant growth originate from rock. Rock samples were collected from a variety of IFTNC research sites and analyzed for major and selected trace elements. While this allowed for quantitative comparison of individual elements such as K, an assessment of overall elemental availability to plants via rock weathering was also desired. A modification of Reiche's (1943) weathering potential index (WPI) was selected to evaluate rock contribution to plant-available nutrient pools. Comparison of WPI calculations across 30 IFTNC research sites showed that while basalts and granites had fairly narrow WPI ranges, metasedimentary rocks varied widely. Most of the metasedimentary rocks underlying Inland Northwest forests belong to the Belt Supergroup, which encompasses several formations and a wide variety of lithologies. In order to better categorize the geochemical variation of metasedimentary and other rocks, WPI values were calculated for a wide variety of samples collected by Idaho Geological Survey and U.S. Geological Survey personnel throughout northern Idaho. The WPI values were tabulated by lithology and formation and analyzed for differences that might help explain variation in forest nutritional status.",2003-11-01,yes,research (document genres); fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,"Garrison-Johnston, M.T., R.S.

Eight Year Response to N and N+S Fertilization for the Umatilla Mixed Conifer Study in Northeast Oregon and Southeast Washington,"Garrison, M.T.; Moore, J.A.","Eight study sites were established in 1991 on the Umatilla National Forest to study forest growth response to nitrogen and nitrogen-sulfur fertilization. The eight sites corresponded to four locations, Pomeroy, Pendleton, Ukiah and Heppner, which were arrayed in a linear fashion from northeast to southwest across the Forest. While this location effect was confounded with many other factors, it was an important blocking factor for analyses of fertilization growth response. However, it was difficult to identify which location factors influenced fertilization response. The more mature stands at Pomeroy and Pendleton were analyzed together, while the Ukiah and Heppner sites were analyzed separately. Overall, while both N and N+S showed positive growth responses, N+S provided the greatest eight-year volume response. This response was greatest for the mature stands at the Pomeroy and Pendleton study sites. A positive N+S response did occur at Heppner, but was only detectable in analysis of relative volume response. Ukiah did not show a significant fertilization response. Both Heppner and Ukiah were difficult to analyze and understand due to problems inherent in their small tree sizes and open-grown conditions, as well as to wide variation in initial conditions. Two-year periodic volume growth was also calculated and displayed for each of the four locations.

Ponderosa pine nitrogen (N) status was often better than the N-status of other Inland Northwest species, and therefore growth response to N fertilization was often lower than that of other species. Fertilization of ponderosa pine with N alone sometimes appeared to cause increased tree susceptibility to mortality by insect, disease and perhaps abiotic stresses. Growth and mortality response to N fertilization appeared to be related to foliage potassium (K)/N ratio in some cases. The application of K and micronutrients in combination with N may have protected the trees from N-related mortality while stimulating a growth response. Sulfur fertilization was not found to evoke a growth response in ponderosa pine, and may have increased mortality rates slightly. On certain rock types and vegetation series, ponderosa pine showed high growth response to macronutrient plus micronutrient fertilization as well as herbicide treatment. Ponderosa pine generally did not show a strong growth response to N fertilization, except on 'good' rock types on moist sites. Multinutrient (macro- plus micronutrient) fertilization combined with an herbicide treatment often provided a better response than N alone on moderate to dry sites and/or 'bad' rock types. Other species in mixed-conifer stands, particularly grand fir (Abies grandis (Dougl. ex D. Don) Lindl.), often showed a better growth response to fertilization than ponderosa pine. The nutritional ecology of ponderosa pine is unique among Inland forest tree species and should be considered when evaluating nutrient management options.",2005-01-01,yes,research (document genres); fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,"Garrison-Johnston, Mariann, Terry Shaw, Peter Mika and Leonard R.

Fate of Applied Sulfate in Volcanic Ash-Influenced Forest Soils,"Kimsey, Jr., M.; McDaniel, P.; Strawn, D.; Moore, J.","Forests in the Inland Northwest, USA, commonly show SO4 defi-ciency, suggesting limited SO4 availability in the soils. Regional soils, which lie between the east slopes of the northern Cascade Range and the west slopes of the northern Rocky Mountains, are influenced to varying degrees by poorly crystalline aluminosilicates and ferrihydrite, and are often classified as Andisols (Andosols). Research has shown that SO4 retention is greatly influenced by Fe and Al oxides. However, little is known of the sorption behavior exhibited by poorly crystalline andic soils of the region. In this study we investigated the mineralogy and SO4 sorption capacity of ash-influenced soils found in the Inland Northwest. Batch SO4 adsorption experiments showed that up to 40% of added SO4 was adsorbed. Furthermore, there were positive correlations between soil SO4 adsorption capacity and increasing ash influence as measured by (i) the andic soil parameter % Alo + 0.5%Feo (R2 = 0.89), (ii) P retention (R2 = 0.91), and (iii) NaF pH (R2 = 0.48). Soil pH, total organic C (TOC), and percentage of clay showed insignificant or inconclusive relationships with SO4 adsorption. Re-lease of adsorbed SO4 was significantly lower in volcanic ash-influenced soils as compared with non-ash soils, indicating a greater affinity for SO4. These results indicate that poorly crystalline aluminosilicates and Fe oxides significantly influence the amount of SO4 present in forest soil solutions.

Effects of Machine Traffic on the Physical Properties of Ash-Cap Soils,"Johnson, L.R.; Page-Dumroese, D.; Han, H.","With pressure and vibration on a soil, air spaces between soil particles can be reduced by displaced soil particles. Activity associated with heavy machine traffic increases the density of the soil and can also increase the resistance of the soil to penetration. This paper reviews research related to disturbance of forest soils with a primary focus on compaction in ash-cap soils. The general process of compaction is described along with physical properties of ash-cap soils that relate to compaction. Ash-cap soils have physical soil properties most closely aligned to silt-loam soils. Undisturbed ash-cap soils often have low bulk densities to variable depths. Under moisture conditions near field capacity, these soils are susceptible to significant disturbance from machine traffic, and when the disturbance causes increases in bulk density, the soils are not likely to recover from this disturbed condition for many years. Machine traffic on forest soils generally occurs as a result of some form of active stand management including precommercial thinning, intermediate and final timber harvest, and site preparation activities involving slash disposal and treatment. The direct contact between equipment and the forest soil will result in some type of soil disturbance. The degree and extent of the soil disturbance is most often controlled through guidelines on the selection and operation of equipment and by restricting the location and operating season for equipment.",2007-01-01,yes,research (document genres); soil science; forest management;,"Johnson, Leonard R., Debbie Page-Dumroese and Han-Sup Han. 2007.

Phylogeographic Patterns of Armillaria ostoyae in the Western United States,"Hanna, J.W.; Klopfenstein, N.B.; Kim, M.S.; McDonald, G.I.; Moore, J.A.","Nuclear ribosomal DNA regions (i.e. large subunit, internal transcribed spacer, 5.8S and intergenic spacer) were sequenced using a direct-polymerase chain reaction method from Armillaria ostoyae genets collected from the western USA. Many of the A. ostoyae genets contained heterogeneity among rDNA repeats, indicating intragenomic variation and likely intraspecific hybridization. Intragenomic variation was verified by visually editing base-sequence offsets in regions with insertions/deletions, and using sequence-specific internal primers to resequence heterogeneous regions. Phylogenetic analyses with Bayesian Inference methods were used to define groups within A. ostoyae. Analysis of A. ostoyae from outside the western USA indicated the presence of a Circumboreal group of A. ostoyae that also occurs in Utah; two other phylogeographic groups were associated with the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Northwest regions of the USA. Mixed sequence types, an indication of intraspecific hybrids, were common in some geographic regions. Hybridization events may have influenced species evolution, contributing to variation in pathogenicity and virulence. The occurrence of these groups and intraspecific hybrids also indicates that paleogeography and paleoclimate may have influenced the phylogeography of A. ostoyae.

Can Portable Pyrolysis Units Make Biomass Utilization Affordable While Using Bio-Char to Enhance Soil Productivity and Sequester Carbon?,"Coleman, M.; Page-Dumroese, D.; Archuleta, J.; Badger, P.; Chung, W.; Venn, T.; Loeffler, D.; Jones, G.; McElligott, K.","We describe a portable pyrolysis system for bioenergy production from forest biomass that minimizes long-distance transport costs and provides for nutrient return and long-term soil carbon storage. The cost for transporting biomass to conversion facilities is a major impediment to utilizing forest biomass. If forest biomass could be converted into bio-oil in the field, it may be more profitable to utilize forest biomass for bioenergy. Bio-oil can substitute for fuel oil, or be used as a crude oil and further refined into additional products. Transporting energy-dense bio-oil is more cost effective than transporting bulky, low-value biomass. In-woods pyrolysis can also address concerns over removing nutrients and carbon from forest sites through reapplication of bio-char, a pyrolysis byproduct, which is equivalent to the charcoal found in all fire ecosystems. Bio-char is 70-80 percent carbon and retains most nutrients contained in biomass. It can be used as a soil amendment to enhance soil productivity through a liming effect, which improves cation exchange capacity and base saturation, increasing anion availability, improving water holding capacity and decreasing bulk density. Charcoal is known to remain stable in soils for hundreds to thousands of years. Long charcoal residence times provide a way to quickly sequester atmospheric carbon by assimilating it into a recalcitrant form that can be applied to soils. In total the portable pyrolysis approach has the potential to improve the economic efficiency of biomass removal from overstocked forests through the in-woods conversion of biomass to bio-oil that avoids the costs and emissions of transportation to central facilities. Biochar can be returned to the forest economically if pyrolysis occurs at or near the site of biomass removal.

"Bioenergy Production Systems and Biochar Application in Forests: Potential for Renewable Energy, Soil Enhancement, and Carbon Sequestration","McElligott, K.M.; Page-Dumroese, D.; Coleman, M.","Bioenergy production from forest biomass offers a unique solution to reduce wildfire hazard fuel while producing a useful source of renewable energy. However, biomass removals raise concerns about reducing soil carbon and altering forest site productivity. Biochar additions have been suggested as a way to mitigate soil carbon loss and cycle nutrients back into forestry sites; yet, little is known about the effects of intentional biochar amendments to temperate forest soil in conjunction with biomass removals for bioenergy production. In this review, we evaluate the potential for mobile bioenergy systems and the environmental implications of biochar application in forests. Using forest biomass that accumulates annually during forest harvest operations, bioenergy can be produced on-site and the biochar that is generated can be redistributed to return nutrients and help improve water holding capacity of the site. Little is known about the short- and long-term impacts of biochar application in forest ecosystems. Some sites may benefit from biochar application, while others show no or negative responses.

Harvest unit soils were classified as Andisols overlaying metasedimentary parent material within an udic-frigid moisture and temperature regime. Douglas-fir site index at base age 50 was 29 m. Four site preparation conditions were monitored: undisturbed control, broadcast burn, pile and burn, and mechanical scarification. Periodic soil-site measurements were collected on each condition at regeneration stand ages 6, 14 and 24 yrs. Six and 14-yr soil bulk density on scarified conditions were significantly higher at 0-15 and 15-30 cm than all other conditions. Scarified soil bulk density showed recovery to non-scarify condition levels at 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm after 24 yrs. Scarified soil organic matter (SOM) and N were significantly reduced by 32 and 42% over control levels 6 yrs post-harvest. After 24 yrs, scarified SOM and N were significantly lower than that found in broadcast burn (44 and 54%) and pile and burn (33% and 49%). Douglas-fir needle mass and foliar N and P content on scarified conditions were significantly lower than broadcast burn or pile and burn conditions after 24 yrs (p&lt;0.1). Soil and foliar N content was significantly higher in those conditions receiving a burn application after 24 yrs (p&lt;0.1). Tree growth on either burn condition showed significantly greater diameter (35%), height (14%) and volume (92%) when compared to trees growing on scarified conditions after 24 yrs (p&lt;0.1). These results indicate that tree growth on frigid, ash-mantled forest soils of the Inland Northwest can be significantly reduced following soil compaction and displacement of organic-rich topsoil. Where soil disturbance is minimized and organic matter retention is coupled with a burn treatment, soil and tree productivity will be maintained or enhanced.",2012,yes,research (document genres); soil science; statistics;,"Kimsey, M., D.

The Effect of Multi-Nutrient Fertilization on Understory Vegetation Nutrient Concentrations in Inland Northwest Conifer Stands,"VanderSchaaf, C.L.; Moore, J.A.; Kingery, J.L.","This study looked at the effects that multi-nutrient fertilization had on understory vegetation nutrient concentrations at four conifer forested locations in the inland Northwest. Multi-nutrient fertilization of conifer stands cannot only enhance the overstory species in the inland Northwest but also the understory vegetation. Determination of nutrient concentration response to fertilization treatments can provide managers the ability to better manipulate their forests for grazing and wildlife habitat. We grouped the understory vegetation into three general life forms: forbs, grasses and grass-likes, and shrubs. Multi-nutrient fertilization had little effect on nitrogen concentration across all life forms. Potassium and sulfur generally increased in concentration. Micronutrients as a whole showed less variability in response to multi-nutrient fertilization. Boron, copper, molybdenum, and zinc generally showed increases in concentrations across all life forms.We were able to conduct analyses on a selected number of understory vegetation species. Individual species showed variability in nutrient concentration response to multi-nutrient fertilization. Wildlife habitat and grazing quality were both increased and decreased following multi-nutrient fertilization. Increases in nutrient concentrations will provide more nutritious vegetation to these animals and vice versa for decreases in concentrations.",2003-10-01,yes,research (document genres); shrubs; grasses (plants); fertilizer; statistics;,"VanderSchaaf, C.L., J.A.

Ash Cap Influences on Site Productivity and Fertilizer Response in Forests of the Inland Northwest,"Garrison-Johnston, M.T.; Mika, P.G.; Miller, D.L.; Cannon, P.; Johnson, L.R.","Data from 139 research sites throughout the Inland Northwest were analyzed for effects of ash cap on site productivity, nutrient availability and fertilization response. Stand productivity and nitrogen (N) fertilizer response were greater on sites with ash cap than on sites without. Where ash was present, depth of ash had no effect on site productivity or N fertilizer response. Site productivity increased with increasing potentially available soil water. Potentially available soil water, in turn, increased with increasing ash depth. Decreasing availability of magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) in the upper 12 inches of soil may have constrained site productivity with increasing ash depth. Soil mineralizable N and ammonium N were unaffected by ash presence or depth but did vary by underlying parent material. Site productivity and N fertilizer response varied by underlying parent material even after accounting for ash presence. Stand volume response to sulfur (S) fertilization decreased with increasing ash depth, suggesting possible S adsorption by ash cap.

Wilderness in a Balanced Land Use Framework,Frank Church,"Lecture given by Senator Frank Church. Introduction by Dr. John H, Ehrenreich: Dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences, and Director of the Wilderness Research Center at the Univeristy of Idaho. The lecture covers the Senator's perspective of his election in 1962 and how his campaign was linked to the Wilderness Bill. It then covers the following years and how the Wilderness Act was put into action by various branches of the government  and how continued action needed to be made by congress. The lecture also touches on how other lands can be managed better to make up for the loss of the lands deemed 'Wilderness'. Lastly the lecture reviews various interpretations of the Wilderness Act and how use of the land deemed 'Wilderness' is being too restricted by certain government orginizations.

The lecture begins by defining 'wilderness' focusing specifcally on the definition of 'a wild condition or quality'. The lecture then compares conservation and management to that of a librarian caring for, organizing, and learning from books. The lecture claims that returning to the untouched wilderness of the past is undesirable, but  instead to balance an increased demand of public recreation with preservation and protection. Examples are given of increased visitor use and management of humans is named the most difficult long term management problem.

Battle for the Wilderness: Our Forever Conflict?,Michael Frome,"Lecture given by Michael Frome. Introduction by Dr. Terry R. Armstrong, Executive Assistant to the President, University of Idaho. The lecture  looks at the concept of wilderness preservation and the viability of it in the 1980's socio-political context. Frome opens with a commentary on Secretary of the Interior, James G. Watt's view of wilderness. He rebuttals the Secretary's extreme views of Democrats and environmentalists with the idea that conservation is the American mindset. The lecture then emphasizes the need to preserve wilderness, 'for its own sake, not for its utility'. This is again emphasized through the metaphor of an interpreter of art; humans cannot create a landscape, only enjoy it and create homages to nature,quoting and citing many authors and artists. The article then expresses Frome's strong belief in the 'reverence of life' that all lives (including those of plants and animals) are important and that 'we are responsible to the future and for the present. The lecture then details victories of conservation in Idaho, including the River of No Return Wilderness. The lecture concludes with the speaker's dedication to the idea of democracy as a tool for the people to gain power and responsibility of conserving wilderness. Bibliography is included and the last page is an announcement by Dr. Edwin E.

In Celebration of Wilderness: The Progress and the Promise,Brock Evans,"Lecture given by Brock Evans. Opening remarks by Dr. Ed Krumpe, Associate Professor in the University of Idaho Department of Wildland Recreation Management and Director of the University of Idaho Wilderness Research center. Introduction by Michael Frome. The lecture commences with a brief discussion of Evans' recent defeat in the run for congress, as touched on in the introduction, and why he is glad to be back at the University. The lecture details the long hours and intensive schedule needed to campaign for office, the impact on a canadite's psyche and the process of learning how to operate as a politician. The lecture then ties into the subject of wilderness and why  people feel so strongly about it. Evans gives his own first experience with wilderness, in Glacier National Park, how he moved to Seatle, and got a job protecting wilderness areas with the Sierra Club. The lecture continues the story of Evans' congressional defeat and how a trip into Olympic National Park helped him to heal from that experience. The lesson of the wilderness, he says, is that there is something out there bigger than ourselves and that it will go on. The lecture then sites environmentalists throughout America's history calling for it's preservation, and now that that preservation exists people should not forget that it was fought hard for. The lecture continues with a look at how far conservation has come in four states since the 1960's. Lastly two stories are told exemplifying Evans' motto of 'endless pressure, endlessly applied' as a strategy for winning wilderness conservation through polotics and an example is given of the happy results after those victories are won.

The lecture opens with Andrus' own experiences in the wilderness and how he developed his philosophy of 'environmental concern' using it as a central campaign issue. Andrus expresses the need to learn from the mistakes of the past and to treat the wildernesss with common sense, becoming good stewards. The lecture highlights the dichotomy of number of acres owned by the government, compared to the amount of those acres that have been designated 'Wilderness'. The lecture calls for a creation of a 'Department of Natural Resources as proposed by President Carter' to better orginize and manage wilderness.

Ables: Associate Dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences, and Director of the Wilderness Research Center at the Univeristy of Idaho. The lecture opens with a brief history of conservation as an idea in the United States and the current state of urbanization and pollution as well as predictions of urbanization in the future. The lecture goes on to describe the current attitude towards conservation and the environment in the 1980's and how that attitude is beginning to change. The lecture also touches on the education of real estate developers about conservation, that is to say, little or none. The attitude to shift is viewing the land as a commodity, to viewing it as a resource. It highlights the tension between the need for both urban growth and conservation in the future, an interdisciplinary effort. The lecture outlines some of the most pressing problems for conservation in the 80's. Another perspective change is the percieved value of the 'free work' of nature, and how to evaluate the economic value of nature as it exists as a whole, not just it's resources. The lecture closes with a commendation to organize and to work together to continue to make conservation more efficient in the future.

Wilderness Management: A Contradiction in Terms?,Roderick Nash,"Lecture given by Dr. Roderick Nash. Introduction by Dr. John H, Ehrenreich: Dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences, and Director of the Wilderness Research Center at the Univeristy of Idaho. Dr. Nash's lecture opens with a bold statement that 'Wilderness does not exist' and is instead 'a state of mind evoked by a state of nature' and then proceeds to define wilderness as seen by the Wilderness Act. He claims that maps have an 'erosive effect on wilderness' and that wilderness used to be 'a circle on a map' that 'concentrated on keeping things like roads and buildings out'. The lecture details how management became a necesity as time went by and more people recreated in the National Parks and Wilderness Areas and that usage 'could damage natural conditions just as severely as lumbering, mining, and commercial grazing.', he emphazises this through the use of visitor statistics. The lecture then explores the idea of a 'carrying capacity  of wilderness, the impact of people on nature.' The main point is summed up, wilderness management is a contradiction in terms, but necessary for there to to be any semblance of wilderness for people to experience; that they must 'manage so that less management is necessary.'

"Wilderness: Promises, Poetry, and Pragmatism",Jay D. Hair,"Lecture given by Dr. Jay D. Hair, President of the National Wildlife Federation. Introduction by Dr. Edwin E. Krumpe, Director of the University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center. The lecture opens by touching on three aspects of the wilderness debate: Promises, Poetry, and Pragmatism. The promises section opens with the history of The Wilderness Act, and how it is only until recently that wilderness has been viewed as 'a vital part of civilization'. The poetry section looks to shed light on why we need wilderness using excerpts of poetry from two poets. The last section, pragmatism, explains how the problems of conserving wilderness are growing more complex and so our perspectives should grow as well. Mass exctinction is addressed as a large problem, and not just a poetic problem, a pragmatic one, that affects the scientific community, not to mention the economy. An example of scientific research is given to emphasize the importance of long term scientific research. Statistics are shared to highlight the global pharmaceutical industries releiance on wilderness, and Idaho's dependence on wilderness to fuel the local tourism industry. Emphasis is laid, once again, on the importance of long term scientific research in wilderness. The lecture compares President John Kennedy's push to land a man on the moon to the possibility of creating an inventory of the earth's resources. The lecture continues with a challenge to ask the right questions when doing research, to organize our efforts and relate the research to other science and socioeconomic research, forming a complete picture. Lastly the lecture challanges us to have a new attitude towards research, to let it be chaotic, controversial, and moved into the sphere of politics and lawmaking quickly. Bibliography included.

Using Wilderness Experiences to Enhance Human Potential and Understanding,Ian Player,"Lecture given by Ian Player DSM. Opening remarks by Dr. Edwin E. Krumpe associate professor at the Univeristy of Idaho, Department of Wildland Recreation Management, and Director of the Wilderness Research Center. Introduction by John C. Hendee, Dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences at the University of Idaho. The lecture opens with thanks and greetings, and an anecdote about how  gatherings are best held in the outdoors, which inspire dignity. The lecture is a testimony to Player's own experience with wilderness and how it has impacted his life. The lecture opens with the context of his country, South Africa, which is complicated. It continues with the speaker's perspective of World War II from the front lines in Italy. After the war Player canoed a 110 miles stretch of the African wilderness, his first experience in the wild. The lecture then details Player's experience on the Natal Parks Board and protecting wildlife from poachers. The lecture gives an example of humans being an important predator in the ecosystem. Poetry is touched on as an important tool to communicate the value of conservation. The lecture transitions into the story of Player's involvement in the protection of the endangered White Rhino and antelope. Once again Player speaks of how taking people on treks into the wilderness in small groups changes their perspectives. The lecture details the wisdom of a South African native Magqubu Ntombela who knew much and taught Player a lot about the land and it's wildlife. The story of how those wilderness treks turned into The Wilderness Leadership School, often a spiritual experience for those who participated. The gatherings at the end of these treks then turned into The World Wilderness Congress, where people from many countries gathered to inspire conservation. The lecture concludes with an illustration of hope, and an exhortation to build the future on hope.

The lecture touches on the irony of white men trying to eradicate the indigenous peoples' way of life, but then requiring guidance from those peoples, guidance they are only able to provide because of their way of life. Frustration at false spiritual leaders and 'shammans' is expressed and a reminder is given that this is a selfish and cheap way to treat the traditions held for so long by many people. The spiritual law of the Native Americans is explained and emphisis is laid on maintaining stable life support systems, namely water resources. History is given to detail the treaties forged between the founding fathers and the Native Americans. The lecture emphasizes our responsibilities to honor the treaties that our fore-fathers signed. This goal can be accomplished, it will take hard work but Chief Lyons thinks we are capable, we have a common cause, the future of wilderness and the rest of the earth.",1989-04-20,,lectures; indigenous people; wilderness;,University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center,University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center,wrdl10,application/pdf,Text,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

A Vision for Wilderness in the National Forests,William A. Worf,"Lecture given by William A. Worf, President of Wilderness Watch. Opening remarks given by Dr. Edwin E. Krumpe, principal scientist for the Wilderness Research Center and associate professor in the Department of Resource Recreation and Tourism. Introduction by John C. Hendee, dean of the Collefe of Forestry, Wildlife and Rancge Sciences, and acting director of the Wilderness Reseach Center. The lecture opens with the story of Aldo Leopold and others who inspired the idea of wilderness in the United States. How wilderness has been percieved and protected in the 60's is then given a brief description, including the operations and vision of a task force put into effect by the Forest Service after the Wilderness Act is passed. The struggle of defining how to manage wilderness differently than a recreation area is portrayed. The lecture shows hope in the way wilderness will be prioritized by the Forest Service in the future and steps to be taken to assure that comes about. The lecture concludes with the concept as wilderness being the central vision of the Forest Service in the 21st century.

A Vision for Wilderness in the National Parks,Roger Contor,"Lecture given by Roger Contor. Introduction by John C. Hendee, dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences, and director of the Wilderness Research Center. The lecture starts by calling for better political representation for the National Parks. The history of the role (or lack therof) that the Parks played in the Wilderness Act is reviewed as is the reason that the Parks manage their lands differently from the Forest Service. The lecturer displays a few slides of Alaskan Wilderness and Idaho superimposed on a map of Alaska to show the extent and porportion of wilderness in that state. The lecture also displays three species (the grizzly bear, the Dall sheep, and the caribou) as exhibits of what the wilderness holds. The lecturer then expresses his opinion that the National Parks have failed to lead the charge in political protection of wilderness. The lecturer proposes that the solution is to: 'Establish wilderness leadership at the top. Appoint leaders who understand wilderness. Educate people that No Trace Wilderness is possible. Document wilderness values with research. Support those who seek excellence in wilderness. Protect the mystery of wilderness. Reopen communication with Congress. Re-establish cooperative relationships with conservation organizations. Restore wilderness naturalness. Re-establish natural fire regimes. Establish trail patterns compatible with wilderness. Protect diversity with appropriate management. Eliminate wilderness structures and non-historic artifacts. Establish a high ethic for legal hunting in the Alaskan park units. Restore the professional spirit of the Park Service.' The lecture closes with a few more points about the benefits of wilderness as a mesuring stick for the how we are affecting the rest of the world and placing the blame soundly on the political leaders once again. A list of past lecturers and the titles of their lectures are listed.",1992-12-03,,lectures; national parks; politics; wilderness areas; land management; wilderness;,University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center,University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center,wrdl12,application/pdf,Text,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

A Vision for Wilderness in the National Wildlife Refuge System,Bill Reffalt,"Lecture given by Bill Reffalt. Opening Remarks by Edwin E. Krumpe principal scientist for the Wilderness Research Center and professor in the Department of Resource Recreation and Tourism. Introuction by John C. Hendee dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences and director of the University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center. The lectre opens with a definition of wilderness and what that means for National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS). An introduction is given for the NRWS and how it's purpose is to protect the fish and wildlife, not it's reputation among humans. Refuges span across the United States and it's territories, often focusing on endangered or threatened species. A color slideshow was then presented by the lecturer. The slideshow begins with Alaska, portraying the caribou as a token species that uses the wilderness. In the Pacific Northwest wilderness can be found along the coastline. In the Southwest many desert biomes have been preserved as wilderness. The Midwest and Lake States are home to natural prairies and marshlands. The Northeast holds a 3,000 acre forest swamp. The Southeast has their unique swampland, the Everglades. The lecture then discusses how the Wilderness Act was applied to those refuges, mostly poorly. The lecture then details how that poor enaction of the legeslation is being changed. Unique problems associated with different types of wilderness are described, including Island Wilderness and U.S. Military activity in wilderness. The lecture then details a future plan to incorporate the NWRS with the Wilderness Act. The current paradigm that wildlife managers are operating under is described and a call is made to shift that paradigm. The new model is described as a holistic management program. The proposal is made that wilderness itself is a tool for managers to use, a baseline resource. A list of opportunities that wilderess gives to managers of refuge systems is given. The lecture closes with a Walt Whitman quote. A bibliography is included. A list of past lecturers and the titles of their lectures are listed.",1994-03-03,,lectures; habitat; wildlife refuges; wilderness areas; land management; wilderness;,University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center,University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center,wrdl13,application/pdf,Text,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

"Wilderness Management of Public Lands Administered by the Bureau of Land Management: Past, Present & Future",Michael Dombeck,"Lecture given by Michael Dombeck, acting Director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Opening remarks given by Edwin E. Krumpe, principal scientist for the Wilderness Research Center and professor in the Department of Resource Recreation and Tourism. Introduction by John C. Hendee director of the UI Wilderness Research Center and former dean of the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences. The lecture opens with the theme for the past three lectures and how this lecture about the BLM will match that theme as well. The history of the BLM and the Wilderness Act is breifly gone over as well as how their relationship was affected by the Federal Lands Policy and Management Act (FLPMA). Then the current status of the BLM and the FLPMA is given an overview. An inventory of BLM land was taken and the result was 26,000,000 acres were recommended for wilderness designation. That land was managed differently than other BLM lands and designated Wilderness Study Areas (WSAs). Studies were then conducted on these lands, attempting to find out if the area was better suitable for wilderness or nonwilderness uses, the process of how that is answered is further described in the lecture. At the time the lecture was given all studies had been completed and the recommendations from those studies were pending in Congress. During the 1980's time was taken to prepare for these new wilderness areas by creating management policies, borrowing heavily from the other wilderness agencies. Some areas were designated by congress as wilderness in order for the BLM too put these management policies into practice. Vision is cast for the near future of managing these lands, much of that happening in the political realm. A description of the diversity of BLM lands is given based on physical, socio-economic, and institutional and management charactersitics. The lecture ends will a call for the public to take part in caring for wilderness on BLM lands.  A list of past lecturers and the titles of their lectures are listed.",1995-02-01,,lectures; wilderness areas; land management; wilderness;,University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center,University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center,wrdl14,application/pdf,Text,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

A Vision for Wilderness in the Nation,Jon Roush,"Lecture given by Jon Roush, president of the Wilderness Society. Opening remarks given by James R. Fazio, professor in the Department of Resource Recreation and Tourism, College of Foretry, Wildlife and Range Sciences. Introduction given by John C. Hendee director of the University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center. The lecture opens discussing the previous lectures in the series and how this lecture will differ from the rest. The lecture will detail the threats to wilderness and what can be done to stop them. The lecture clarifies that a threat against wilderness is a threat against wilderness values and then asks the question why we have those values in the first place. We value wilderness for diversity, immediate utility, spirituality (spiritual healing), 'land ethic' because it is ethical to value and protect it. The biggest threat that the lecturer focuses on is population growth. The exponential rate at which the world's population is growing is highlighted. The fact that earth's resources are finite is addressed, in particular food and water resources. A discussion is made about the possibility of the U.S. declining their consumption and lowering their standard of living, but the lecturer says this isn't a solution, it's an inevitability. China is contrasted to our nation as a picture of what we could become, but not one we want to emulate. The consquences of a doubled population in the U.S. by 2020 are discussed. One of those consquences that is detailed in length is the incresed use of wilderness recreation areas, national parks and national forests. The other change that comes with an increasing population is unpredictable cultural change; shifts in perception, even what is right and wrong, regarding wilderness. 'Our wilderness system depends... on people's willingness to take the long view, to act responsibly toward future generations, and to give up some personal gain for the common good.' Two issues for safegaurding wilderness against this danger are explored: How to build an informed, diverse consituency for wilderness and how to confront population issues directly and openly. The lecture then turns to public land policy. A call is given to complete the federal wilderness system while there is still time, wilderness designation and land aquisition are also priorities. But the most crucial element is wilderness management. The National Wildlife Refuge System is used for many purposes other than being a refuge to wildlife, the purpose of these systems must be spelled out in the legislature and enforced. Agencies should combine forces to manage wilderness in tandem. Our goals for wilderness can no longer be economical, but rather ecological. Legislators cannot become lax about environmental regulations put on private land. Our actions and regulations now will affect the overpopulated generations of the future.

Wilderness Vision Questing and the Four Shields of Human Nature,Steven Foster and Meredith Little,"Lecture given jointly by Steven Foster and Meredith Little. Opening remarks by Edwin E. Krumpe principal scientist for wilderness management in the Wilderness Research Center, professor in the Department of Resource Recreation and Tourism. Introduction by John C. Hendee director of the University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center. The lecture begins by introducing the School of Lost Borders, a wilderness retreat and vision quest program. The lecturer describes the need for rites of passage into adulthood in today's culture and society. In the past the context of wilderness provided a pathway into adulthood and while that still persists today there is no longer any community to witness and respect that transition. The rites of passage that the school offers draw from many different cultural traditions but they all have the same three stages: severance, threshold, and incorporation. The lecturers discus the role of the wilderness guide in these stages, defining them as midwives who assist the vision quest participants to give birth to themselves. A training process that the guides use called 'mirroring' is described, a kind of therapy that focuses on the positive aspect of the stories rather than the problems. This theraputic process is based on 'The Four Shields', a world view based on the four seasons correlating with a period of life. Summer and Fall are described as childhood and initiation, Winter and Spring as adulthood and rebirth. The vision  of these rites of passage are often very tangible rather than supernatural and the true power of the visions come from their enactment by the participant after the vision quest is over and they have returned to their regular lives. The Four Shields approach is really about balance and harmony between these stages of life and mentalities. A short video is shown. The lecture concludes with a question and answer session, some of which are included in the transcript. A list of suggested reading is given. A list of past lecturers and the titles of their lectures are listed.",1996-05-02,,lectures; initiations; fasts (events); visions (life events); initiates (people); rites of passage; wilderness areas; land management; wilderness;,University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center,University of Idaho Wilderness Research Center,wrdl16,application/pdf,Text,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.
