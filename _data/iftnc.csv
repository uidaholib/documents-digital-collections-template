IFTNC - 5th Annual Report,"Forest fertilization for enhancing tree growth and improving the value of harvested timber has been an effective silvicultural practice in the Inland Northwest forests. Early large scale study trials were installed in 1980, 1981 and 1982 to study the effects of nitrogen fertilization on forest nutrition, growth and survival of second-growth, even-aged Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir. A total of 98 research sites located across six ecologically diverse geographic regions throughout the Intermountain Northwest were respectively monitored for twelve, fourteen and sixteen years after establishment. Subsequent evidence from the Douglas-fir trials suggested that elements other than nitrogen, particularly potassium, may be limiting on some forest site types and may have significant influence on forest health. In response, a subset of the original trials was retreated in 1987 and 1988 with nitrogen and/or nitrogen plus potassium treatments.

The RSG function is formulated as a quadriatic equation relating relative tree basal area growth to relative tree basal area.  The shape and curvature of RSG function are determined by initial mean tree size, stand density and structure.

IFTNC - Six Year Fertilizer Response of Managed Second-Growth  Douglas-fir Stands in the Inland Northwest,"Growth data collected from 94 Douglas-fir sites in  six geographic regions of the Intermountain Northwest  were used to determine six-year growth response of  managed Douglas-fir stands to two rates of nitrogen  fertilizer. Fertilizer rates were 200 and 400 pounds  nitrogen per acre in the form of urea. An analysis of  covariance model was used to estimate treatment effects  and differences in growth among regions, adjusting  for site differences in initial basal area per acre.In 1980, 1981 and 1982 the Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) established large scale fertilization study trials to study the effects of nitrogen fertilization on forest nutrition, growth and survival of second-growth, even-aged Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir.

IFTNC - Supplemental Report No. 1: Douglas-fir Foliar Nutrient Characteristics after Nitrogen or Nitrogen plus Potassium Fertilization,"Forest fertilization for enhancing tree growth and improving the value of harvested timber has been an effective silvicultural practice in the Inland Northwest forests. Early large scale study trials were installed in 1980, 1981 and 1982 to study the effects of nitrogen fertilization on forest nutrition, growth and survival of second-growth, even-aged Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir. A total of 98 research sites located across six ecologically diverse geographic regions throughout the Intermountain Northwest were respectively monitored for twelve, fourteen and sixteen years after establishment. Subsequent evidence from the Douglas-fir trials suggested that elements other than nitrogen, particularly potassium, may be limiting on some forest site types and may have significant influence on forest health. In response, a subset of the original trials was retreated in 1987 and 1988 with nitrogen and/or nitrogen plus potassium treatments. Technical and refereed documents include initial establishment and growth responses. Additional documentation is also presented for the 1987 and 1988 retreatment.",P. Mika and J. A.

"Poster Paper: Foliar Potassium Status Explains Douglas-fir Response to Nitrogen Fertilization in the Inland Norwest, USA","Despite apparently inadequate N levels throughout the Inland Northwest of the United States, trees on some sites showed no increased growth 8 yr after N fertilization. Nor did higher N application rates consistently produce higher response. These facts indicated that other factors are limiting tree growth at these sites. Results suggest that K status is one important factor, influencing N fertilization response in the following general ways: (I) for stands with low pretreatment foliar K levels, the amount and duration of growth response are reduced, and higher N fertilizer rates produce less response; and (2) for all stands, growth response declines when foliar K decreases after N fertilization.",P.

Two-Year Foliar and Basal Area Response to Multi-Nutrient Re-fertilization for Douglas-fir in South-Central Washington (Windy),"Significant foliar nutrient response due to fertilization was seen for N, S, B and  Cu for Douglas-fir and N, K, S and Cu for ponderosa pine. Nutrient concentration  response was generally higher two growing seasons after fertilization than it was after  one growing season. The low N application rate (90#/ac) did not significantly increase N  concentrations above controls. Those plots receiving the 300#/ac N application rate  showed imbalanced K/N and N/S ratios after treatment. Different application rates of K  did not appear to significantly change K concentrations following treatments.  Foliar analysis also showed deficiencies before treatment as well as treatment  induced deficiencies for all the nutrients applied in this study. According to published  nutrient critical levels; N, S and B were deficient for Douglas-fir, while S, B, Cu and Zn  were deficient for ponderosa pine. Phosphorus, Ca, Mg, Zn and Mo concentrations were  lower on all the fertilized treatments compared to the control. In addition, vector analysis  diagnoses of foliar response revealed S, Cu and Mo deficiencies for Douglas-fir and N, K  and Mo deficiencies for ponderosa pine. Nutrient dilution vectors occurred for all  nutrients relative to the N-Alone treatment.  The fertilizer treatments were successful in significantly (p &lt; 0.10) increasing  foliar needle weights above that of the control for all treatments having micro-nutrients in  the fertilizer mix. Similar to foliar nutrient response, needle weight response tended to be  higher two growing seasons after fertilization than it was after one growing season.  Importantly, only treatments that included micro-nutrients produced significant (p &lt; 0.10)  needle weight increases in 1998 for both Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine. Delayed foliar  nutrient and needle weight responses may be due to spring fertilization, where the effects  of fertilizer treatments may not have been established early or long enough in 1997 for  the trees to show a strong response at the end of one growing season.  Two-year net and gross average basal area response was highest on the K-Alone  and N-Alone treatments with 29% and 16% increases over the control, respectively.  Basal area response was unsignificant (p &lt; 0.10) and less than 10% on those treatments  having micro-nutrients in the fertilizer mix. Low two-year basal area response on the  micro-nutrient treatments may be attributed to delayed foliar nutrient and needle weight  responses due to spring fertilization. Forthcoming results that include both diameter and  height response measurements may provide better information.",Terry M. Shaw; James A.

Foliar nutrient  concentrations, contents, and needle weights ofindividually fertilized ponderosa and  lodgepole pine [Pinus ponderosa (Law.) and Pinus conlorla var. loti/olio (Engelm.) trees  were examined one year following multi-nutrient fertilization. Diagnosis and  interpretation ofnutrient status using graphical vector analysis identified that N, S. and B  were deficient at every research site. Significant needle weight increases, up to 47%, were  observed over the control needle weights from application ofN, NKS + micros. or  NPKSMg + micros fertilizer treatments. Vector analysis also identified Mg deficiencies  on tonalite lithologies, K deficiencies on granodiorite lithologies, and eu and Zn  deficiencies on basalt and tonalite lithologies. respectively. Screening trials proved  effective in determining nutrient deficiencies across soil parent materials on similar habitat  types within one growing season.

Forest Health and Nutrition Study: Establishment Report,"Thirty-one fertilization test sites were established during a three year period, from  1994 through 1996, by the Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative. The sites  were set up under the Third Five Year Study Plan for the IFTNC. The focus ofthis plan  was a new study with a forest nutrition/forest health emphasis. The study covered five  geographical regions ofthe Intermountain region, including north Idaho, central Idaho,  northeast Washington, central Washington, and northeast Oregon. The location,  installation name and number, and ownership ofeach site are provided in this report,  along with the year of establishment and fertilizer regime applied.",Marainn T. Garrison; Terry M.

Two Year Basal Area Response to N and S Fertilization for Mixed Conifer in Northeast Oregon and Southeast Washington (Umatilla),"Two years after fertilizer treatments were applied, the overall adjusted  relative gross basal area response increased 3.1% on those plots receiving 200 lb. nitrogen  (N) acre and 17.0% on those plots receiving 200 lb. N acre plus 100 lb. sulphur (S) acre.  Nitrogen versus S growth response differs by geographic location with the Pomeroy,  Tollgate and Ukiah sites having good N response but little or no S response, while growth  response on the Heppner sites were low for N but increased significantly when S was added  to the fertilizer treatment. Results from this study also show growth response is different  by species, with grand fir expressing higher relative response than western larch or  ponderosa pine for both N and N plus S (NS) treatments. Engelmann spruce and lodgepole  expressed good relative response while ponderosa pine generally had low or negative  response. Response results for Douglas-fir were inconsistent by site and therefore species  specific trends could not be concluded.",Terry M. Shaw; James A.

Biochar Amendments to Forest Soils: Effects on Soil Properties and Tree Growth,"Bioenergy production from forest biomass offers a unique solution to reduce wildfire hazard fuel while producing a useful source of renewable energy. However, biomass removals raise concerns about reducing soil carbon (C) and altering forest site productivity. Biochar additions have been suggested as a way to mitigate soil C loss and cycle nutrients back into forestry sites; yet, little is known about the effects of intentional biochar amendments to temperate forest soil in conjunction with biomass removals for bioenergy production. This research evaluates the potential environmental implications of biochar application in forests by examining: (1) the potential for mobile bioenergy and biochar co-production systems in forests, (2) the influence of biochar and biochar application method on standard forest soil properties of three Inland Northwest soils, and (3) the effects of biochar and biochar application rate on poplar growth (a cultivar of Populus trichocarpa Torr. & Gray) in various forest soils. The results indicate that biochar contributes to notable short-term soil chemical alterations associated with blending the properties of biochar with those of various soil types, but the nature and scope of the alterations vary by soil type and application method. The soil nutrient alterations do not appear to affect tree growth in the short-term, as biochar had a neutral main effect on poplar growth. These results suggest that biochar produced from bioenergy production could be returned to forest soils to replenish soil nutrient stocks and enhance C storage, with little to no affect on tree growth in the short-term. Results from these studies provided a basic understanding of the potential for biochar in our region, and offer several primary implications for biochar management that could contribute to a  comprehensive plan for continuing forest bioenergy production systems.","McElligott, K.M.",2011-05-01,Mark Coleman (Major Professor),research; fire prevention; forest management; timber (lumber);,research; fire prevention; forest management; timber (lumber);,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA","Forest Biomass Removal, Utilization (Bio-energy) and Soil Enhancement (Biochar)",College of Graduate Studies University of Idaho,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"McElligot, K.M. 2011.

A Comparative Financial Analysis of Fast Pyrolysis Plants in Southwest Oregon,"There are millions of acres of forestland in the Western United States that could benefitfrom fuel reduction treatments to improve forest health and reduce wildfire fuels. These treatments generate forest residues that are typically piled and burned. However, with increasing concerns about energy security, high oil prices, air quality from pile burning and climate change, there is great interest in examining ways to economically use these residues as a renewable energy source. Pyrolysis of forest biomass is one method that shows promise, though the financial feasibility of doing so has not been previously investigated. This study presents the expected financial performance of a mobile and a fixed pyrolysis plant in southwest Oregon, where stocks of forest biomass are high. The tradeoffs between using a smaller plant deployed in the forest and a larger centralized plant are then discussed.  Pyrolysis of forest residues involves using advanced technology to thermally degrade biomass in the absence of oxygen to produce bio-oil, biochar and syngas. The syngas is used entirely to provide thermal process energy for the pyrolysis system. Bio-oil can substitute for #2 fuel oil in some applications or be upgraded to produce higher value products. Biochar can be used as a substitute for coal or a valuable soil amendment that can sequester carbon and improve desirable soil properties such as water and nutrient holding capacity.  Information about costs, revenues and production rates for fast pyrolysis systems have been collected from existing pyrolysis firms and likely suppliers of goods and services to pyrolysis firms in Oregon. Financial performance is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis to determine net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) for each plant.  Benefits of an in-woods mobile plant include shorter biomass haul distances that contribute to a lower raw material input cost of $20 per bone dry ton (BDT), as opposed to $45 per BDT for the larger fixed-site plant. The ability to operate separate from the electrical grid and re-locate multiple times per year gives flexibility to the mobile plant. Advantages of the fixed plant include cost savings from economies of scale and lower bio-oil delivery costs. The baseline financial performance assessments for both plants are encouraging, with positive NPV and estimates of 7% and 21% IRR for the mobile and fixed plants, respectively. Sensitivity analyses have revealed that financial performance is particularly dependent on initial capital costs, labor and feedstock costs, and projected bio-oil and bio-char prices.","Sorenson, C.B.",2010-05-01,,research; pyrolysis;,research; pyrolysis;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA","Forest Biomass Removal, Utilization (Bio-energy) and Soil Enhancement (Biochar)","Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Colin Sorenson, A Comparative Financial Analysis of Fast Pyrolysis Plants in Southwest Oregon, 2001",A_Comparative_Financial_Analysis_of_Fast_Pyrolysis_Plants_in_Southwest_Oregon_IFTNC_2010,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,"This document is provided by the University of Idaho Library for use by University of Idaho students, staff, and faculty.

Soil Volcanic Ash and Douglas-Fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco var. glauca) Productivity in North and Central Idaho,"Volcanic ash distribution, thickness, and its role in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco var. glauca) site index (SI) were determined for a forested region of north central Idaho. Ash thickness (AT) and Douglas-fir SI measurements were collected from local Natural Resource Conservation Service soil surveys and through newly installed field plots. Climatic, ecological, edaphic, geologic, and topographic data were collected from field observations or derived from digital elevation models. Three statistical models were developed to estimate AT and two models for predicting Douglas-fir SI. The modelled relationships were spatially displayed using a geographicl information system (GIS).  Statistical model 1 was developed to estimate AT using ecologically based plant associations as an explanatory variable. Climax plant associations moister than grand fir-queen cup beadlily (Abies grandis/Clintonia uniflora) had consistently thick ash mantles and soils that would be classified as either Andisols or andic subgroups using Soil Taxonomy. Multiple linear regression (MLR) results showed that topographic factors accounted for ~ 29 percent of the explained variance, with elevation accounting for ~ 18 percent alone. Plant associations accounted for ~ 71 percent of the explained variation in AT. The statistical model error of 10.7 cm was significantly lower than the &gt;20 cm variation often found in local soil series. Overall model fit produced an R2 of 0.6. Results suggest that plant associations integrate many of the local factors that influence volcanic ash distribution.  Statistical model 2 was developed to determine AT for situations when climax plant associations are not physically observable. This model was based solely upon topographic factors. Predictive models were developed using MLR and geographically weighted regression (GWR). Results show that elevation, slope, plan curvature, and the wetness index all significantly influence volcanic ash distribution. Similar to model 1, elevation explained the most variation in AT. GWR improved model fit and precision by 36 percent and 30 percent, respectively, over the MLR model (R2A = 0.64). The localized approach of GWR modelling showed that elevation, slope curvature, and the wetness index behaved differently depending on geographic location. This suggests that the global approach of MLR modelling is masking conditional landscape relationships that are unique and highly localized.  Volcanic ash and other climatic, edaphic, geologic, and topographic factors were used to predict Douglas-fir SI using both MLR and GWR in statistical model 3. Elevation, ash depth, slope, and aspect were significantly correlated with Douglas-fir SI. Elevation was found to be nonstationary, indicating that parameter estimates associated with elevation significantly change depending on the geographic location of an observation. SI showed a positive logarithmic response to increasing AT. GWR significantly improved MLR model fit by 28 percent and reduced the sum of square errors by 54 percent (R2A = 0.5). Residuals analysis of MLR SI estimates showed extreme SI overestimation in the south and west portion of our study area. This overestimation was significantly reduced in the GWR model. The significant fit and precision improvements of GWR models suggest that the complex interactions affecting Douglas-fir SI are better analyzed at the local level.","Kimsey, Jr., M.J.",2006-05-01,James A.

"Foliar Nutrient, Root Chemistry, Growth and Carbon Allocation Patterns of Douglas-fir Seedlings Grown Under Different Nitrogen and Potassium Treatments","This research was designed to investigate Douglas-fir seedling nutrition as influenced by four nitrogen and potassium treatments. The results of this study are presented in two sections with these main objectives: 1) to determine the effects of N and K nutrition on Douglas-fir foliar nutrient concentrations, plant growth and carbon allocation patterns; and 2) to determine the effects of nitrogen and potassium nutrition on Douglas-fir root storage and chemical composition.  Experimental design and statistical analysis for this experiment were common for both sections of this paper. Results in both sections are based on data taken at the end of a three-year treatment period. Douglas-fir seedlings were randomly assigned to four nitrogen and potassium treatments within two blocks. Treatment effects on growth and plant chemical parameters were estimated by analysis of variance. General linear contrasts and differences between means by treatment for foliar nutrient data, root chemistry and growth parameters were determined by using least-squares means.  Results from this study have shown that the N treatments significantly altered foliar nitrogen levels, growth rates and carbon allocation patterns in Douglas-fir seedlings. As expected, total biomass, measured as total dry weight, was threefold higher for seedlings receiving the high nitrogen treatments than for seedlings receiving the low nitrogen treatments. Seedling allocation to needles was the same between the high and low nitrogen treatments, but allocation to roots increased while allocation to stem decreased under low nitrogen supply. Potassium supply had little if any significant effect on growth rates or carbon allocation to stems, roots or needles. This study has shown that the Douglas-fir seedlings adjusted to different nitrogen and potassium treatments by changing carbon allocation patterns.  The effects of the nitrogen and potassium treatments on Douglas-fir seedling root production ofsoluble sugar, starch, phenolic and protein-precipitable tannin were observed in this study. Root storage compounds such as starch were reduced in Douglas-fir seedlings receiving the high nitrogen treatments, whereas secondary defensive compounds like phenolics and tannins were reduced in plants receiving low K treatments. Relationships between nitrogen and potassium nutrition lead to storage and secondary compound imbalances.","Shaw, T.M.",1997-04-01,,research; masters theses; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; masters theses; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Seedling Growth and Nutrition,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Shaw, T.M. and J.A.

Modeling Interior Douglas-Fir Growth and Yield Following Thinning and Fertilization Treatments,"A compatible forest growth and yield prediction system has recently been developed for interior Douglas-fir. The core of the prediction system is a whole stand model, Simulation Of Stands (SOS). The whole stand model consists of four components: (1) volume prediction model, (2) basal area prediction model, (3) top height growth model, and (4) survival model. However, primary evaluation of the whole stand model indicated that the basal area prediction model underestimated stand basal area for large basal area, large top height and high stand density. It may be due to the inadequency of model formulation. Therefore, a new basal area prediction model needs to be developed based on biological rationales.","Zhang, L.; Moore, J.A.",1991-03-01,,research; statistics;,research; statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Biometrics and Modeling,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Zhang, L., Moore, J.A. 1991.

Montana Nutrition Guidelines By Rock Type,"Nutrition guidelines for use in conjunction with current digital geology for Montana State. This document was prepared as a guideline for foresters to use in determining appropriate nutrient management strategies for forest stands on various rock types in forests of western Montana. Geologic maps provided through the Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology (MBMG) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) were utilized in the development of these guidelines. The digital maps currently available for the state of Montana are available on the MBMG website at http://www.mbmg.mtech.edu/stmap.htm. For this document we utilized the Kalispell, Western Half of Cut Bank, Wallace, Choteau and Dillon 1:250K maps from the USGS, and the Wallace, Missoula West, Hamilton, Butte, Leodore and Lima 1:100K maps and Butte 1:250K map provided by the MBMG. A lookup table for each individual map accompanies this 'Guidelines by Rock Type' document, and may be joined to the respective digital geology map attribute table to assign the IFTNC categorization to the individual map units.  A total of 516 map units identifying various rock types were identified on the eleven maps included in this report. Each unit was assigned to one of four categories and 47 subcategories for purposes of nutrition guideline recommendations. The following section of the report discusses a little about the lithology and expected weathering behavior of each rock, and provides some nutrient management strategies for each rock category and subcategory. These guidelines are based on our current state of knowledge regarding rocks and forest growth. Our information on fertilization response for Montana forest types is currently very limited; therefore the nutrient management recommendations will be conservative and should not be viewed as absolute. We fully expect these guidelines to be further refined with additional experience and experimentation in Montana.","Garrison-Johnston, M.T.; Johnson, L.",2006-04-01,,research; geological maps; fertilizer; forest management;,research; geological maps; fertilizer; forest management;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Geology - Nutrition and Productivity,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Garrison-Johnston, M.T. and Leonard R.

Forest Nutrient Cycling in a North Idaho Conifer Stand,"Overstory, understory, forest floor and soil elemental contents and litterfall flows of all macronutrients and most micronutrients and aluminum were measured during one growing season in a north Idaho conifer stand. These data were analyzed for differences which might explain past variation in fertilization response. The first phase of the study involved the examination ofsoil nutrient availability as measured by ion exchange resins. Goals were to detect possible causes of variation in past fertilization response, to develop an improved understanding ofseasonal nutrient dynamics, and to examine changes in soil nutrient availability throughout the soil profile. Using ion-exchange resins, differences in elemental availability were detected by experimental block, as well as with soil depth and throughout the growing season. Results were discussed in light of findings by other researchers and used to help explain possible reasons for past variation in forest fertilization response. Soil nutrient availability was also compared to tree nutrient uptake throughout the growing season using graphical interpretation, and correlation analysis was perfonned between Douglas-fir foliar nutrient concentrations and ioin-exchange nutrient availabilitiy. Several interesting findings regarding interpretation ofion-exchange data in light oftree nutrient uptake were discussed. During the second phase ofthis study, differences in macronutrient, micronutrient and aluminum contents ofvarious forest ecosystem components were analyzed and evaluated during one growing season. Block differences in overstory and litterfall contents that may help explain past fertilization response at this site are discussed. Needle attributes of overstory trees showed significant differences by species, crown class, crown position, foliar age class and sampling date. Foliar weight varied with the degree of foliage exposure to sunlight, and elemental foliar contents generally followed the same pattern. Understory vegetation showed significant nutrient content differences between growth fonns and during the growing season for several elements. Litterfall dry weight and elemental contents showed seasonal variation, and forest floor content ofmost elements was within expected ranges. The final phase ofthis study entailed the compilation ofoverstory, understory, forest floor and soil elemental contents and litterfall flows into a systems analysis model, which was then projected over a three-year period. Model simulations were perfonned for three species composition scenarios, including pure grand fir, pure Douglas-fir and mixed conifer. For all species simulations, model components and flows were examined, and both seasonal and annual behavior were evaluated in biological and mechanistic terms. Significant differences in overstory elemental content and related flows were revealed through simulation of various species compositions. Overall, systems analysis was a useful tool for evaluating forest elemental cycling, and provided a better understanding of seasonal and short-tenn nutrient dynamics and component interactions of our experimental stand. Suggestions for future research are discussed in light ofthese findings.","Garrison-Johnston, M.T.",2003-06-01,James A.

Beetle-Caused Mortality in Ponderosa Pine: Induced by Nitrogen Fertilization but Prevented by Potassium Amendment,"In 1987 six fertilizer trials were established in ponderosa pine stands in western Montana, USA to test if K amendments to N fertilizers could ameliorate increases in tree mortality associated with N fertilization. Treatments were no fertilizer, 225 kg ha' of N, or 225 kg ha' of both N and K. Foliage samples were collected and analyzed for nutrients one year following treatment and tree heights and diameters were measured at the time of and four years after treatment. Analysis of covariance results showed that fertilization with N alone produced a negative net volume response, but plots receiving both N and K responded positively, producing a highly significant K effect. Treatment differences resulted from heavy tree mortality caused by mountain pine beetle occurring on N treated plots, but not on N+K treated plots. Regression of net volume response on foliar nutrient levels indicated that negative response (beetle mortality) occurred in stands having high initial foliar N concentrations and low K:N ratios. When fertilized with N+K, these stands showed similar net response as all other stands. Fertilization with N alone appears to have made these stands more susceptible to bark beetle mortality, but addition of K to the fertilizer mix prevents this increase in mortality and allows the stands to respond positively to N additions.","Mika, P.G.; Moore, J.A.; Mandzak, J.D.",1993,,research; wood borers (beetles); fertilizer;,research; wood borers (beetles); fertilizer;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Health and Nutrition,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Mika, P.G., J.A.

Effects of Fertilization Treatments on Klickitat Douglas-fir Sites in South-Central Washington,"Fertilization treatments, (control, 200 lb N/acre, and 200 lb N + 200 lb K lacre), were applied to six Douglas-fir installations (36 plots) in the Klickitat area of south-central Washington, in October, 1990. Measurements were taken before the application of the treatments and again in the Fall of 1992. All live plot trees were tagged and measured for total height and diameter for pre-treatment and diameter only for post-treatment. Foliage samples were collected in Fall, 1991 and analyzed by Camas Analytical Lab, Missoula, Montana. The detailed information about stand characteristics and foliar nutrients for each installation are provided in Appendix A and B. The objective of the statistical analysis is to investigate the treatment effects on stand basal area growth and response. Additional analyses were conducted to relate stand basal area response to pre and post treatment foliage nutrient status.","Moore, J.A.; Zhang, L.; Shaw, T.M.",1993-03-01,,research; forest management; fertilizer; timber (lumber);,research; forest management; fertilizer; timber (lumber);,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Moore, J.A., L.

Evaluation of Simple Quantile Estimation Functions for Modeling Forest Diameter Distributions in Even-Aged Stands of Interior Douglas-fir,"The method of percentiles usually involves simultaneously solving equations for probability distribution parameters as functions of sample-based estimates of the appropriate quantiles. Eight simple distribution-free methods for estimating quantiles from sample-based order statistics were evaluated empirically using even-aged Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco) diameter distributions from the Inland Northwest. Two methods, calculated by weighting adjacent order statistics. consistently gave the best results for both the Weibull and Johnson's So distributions. Certain distributional shapes were also evaluated to determine if they influenced the quantile estimation method. Although some influence was detected. the best methods were usually best across all categories.","Newberry, J.D.; Moore, J.A.; Zhang, L.",1993-03-29,,research; statistics;,research; statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Biometrics and Modeling,Canadian Journal of Forest Research,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Newberry, J.D., J.A.

Disaggregating Stand Volume Growth to Individual Trees,"A disaggregation function, relative size-growth (RSG), was proposed and developed for interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca [Beissn] Franco) to distribute stand volume to a list of individual trees. The RSG function was formulated as a quadratic equation relating relative tree growth to relative tree size in a stand. The shape of the RSG function was linear, convex, or concave depending on initial stand conditions and structure. A recursive system of equations was developed to predict the three coefficients of the RSG function using initial stand density, mean tree size, and coefficient of variation of tree size distribution as predictor variables. This disaggregation function determines within-stand growth of individual trees and simulates stand development and dynamics. The RSG function provides a biologically based link between whole-stand and individual tree resolution models.","Zhang, L.; Moore, J.A.; Newberry, J.D.",1993-05-01,,research; trees; statistics;,research; trees; statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Biometrics and Modeling,Forest Science,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Zhang, L., J.A.

The Role of Nutrition in the Health of Inland Western Forests,"In this paper we present evidence supporting the premise that forest nutrition, nutrient cycling and nutrient management are critical factors for the health of Inland Western forests and for management of the ecosystems. The current state of knowledge suggests that inadequate tree nutrition, particularly potassium shortage, influences tree chemistry such that inadequate plant defensive compounds are produced. Pathogens and insects are unusually successful in attacking such trees. Forest managers have substantial influence on the forest nutritional environment through nearly all types of silvicultural treatments.","Mandzak, J.M.; Moore, J.A.",1905-06-16,,research; forest management; forests (plant communities);,research; forest management; forests (plant communities);,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Health and Nutrition,Journal of Sustainable Forestry; Assessing Forest Ecosystem Health in the Inland West,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Mandzak, J.M. and J.A.

Effects of Intermediate Silvicultural Treatments on the Distribution of Within-Stand Growth,"The distribution of within-stand basal growth following silvicultural treatments was investigated using a relative size -relative growth (RSG) function. The effects of thinning on the distdbution of tree basal area, including changes in location or scale, can be incorporated into the estimation of the RSG function parameters. Additional stand growth due to fertilization can also be allocated to individual trees using the same RSG function, since the contribution of a tree's response to total stand treatment response depends on its relative size in the stand. Statistical tests and validation of the RSG function indicated that thinning and fertilization do not alter the characteristic relationships between tree size, stand density, stand structure, and the relative distribution of growth across size classes within a stand. Therefore, silvicultural treatment growth responses predicted at a whole-stand level of resolution can be disaggregated to a list of individual trees using the RSG function developed from untreated plots.","Moore, J.A.; Zhang, L.; Newberry, J.D.",1993-08-24,,research; forest management; statistics;,research; forest management; statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,Canadian Journal of Forest Research,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Moore, J.A., L.

A Simulation Approach for Predicting the Effect of Douglas-Fir Tussock Moth Defoliation on Juvenile Tree Growth and Stand Dynamics,"A spatially dependent tree growth projection model was developed and used to simulate juvenile grand fir, Abies grandis (Dougl.) Lindl., Douglas-fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco, and ponderosa pine, Pinus ponderosa Laws., in northern Idaho. Simulated experiments using the model examined the effects of Douglas-fir tussock moth, Orgyia pseudotsugata McDunnough, defoliation on stand dynamics during the first 40 years of stand development. The sequence and intensity of the defoliation episodes were varied for different combinations of age, stand density, and tree species composition at the time of the first defoliation. The results are summarized in statistical models which predict the long-term effects of tussock moth defoliationon stand dynamics. Results indicate that the insect regulates primary forest production by reducing stand biomass and by redistributing growth energy from host to nonhost trees by altering intertree competitive relationships to the advantage of nonhosts.","Moore, J.

Relationships of Douglas-fir Tussock Moth Defoliation to Site and Stand Characteristics in Northern Idaho,"Relationships between intensity of defoliation caused by Douglas-fir tussock moth, Orgyia pseudotsugata McDunnough, and descriptive characteristics of forest sites and stands in an outbreak area of northern Idaho were quantified. Defoliation hazard predictive models were  developed from inventory data collected in 70 stands covering a range of successional stages and site and stand conditions within the grand fir-western red cedar ecosystem. Two models are presented, each accounting for approximately 50 percent of the variation in defoliation intensity.  Defoliation was heavier on upper slope and ridgetop sites, negatively correlated with depth of volcanic ash mantle, and positively correlated with host tree age, proportion of grand fir in the stand, and the ratio of stand density or biomass to site index. A hypothesis that tussock moth outbreaks develop in response to changes in host foliage quality resulting from stresses is presented.","Stoszek, K.J.; Mika, P.G.; Moore, J.

Economic Analysis of a Tree Improvent Program for Westerm Larch,"An individual-tree simulation model called Prognosis and an economic subroutine called CHEAPO were used to determine financial rotation ages (in this analysis defined as the age at which net present value is maximized) for stands grown with genetically improved and unimproved western larch (Larix occidentalis) in north Idaho. Three hypothetical but reasonable growth functions were tested on two site classes. Sensitivity analyses showed that the tree improvement investment was likely to be profitable at 4 and 5 percent discount rates on excellent sites and at 4 percent on good sites. The analysis was most sensitive to changes in discount rate, site quality, and cone production rate. It was moderately sensitive to variation in time to seed production, number of productive orchard years, and differences among the assumed biological functions. As the hypothetical growth functions were designed to be conservative, economic gains are likely to be larger than those indicated in the analysis.","Fins, L.; Moore, J.A.",1984-11-01,,research;,research;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,Journal of Forestry,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Fins, L. and J.A.

"Nitrogen, Sulphur and Potassium Concentrations After Fertilization on Mixed Conifer Stands in Northeast Oregon and Southeast Washington","Post fertilization nitrogen, sulphur and potassium foliar nutrient concentrations were examined for several species of conifers. This study found grand fIr (Abies grandis) foliar nitrogen uptake and potassium levels were higher than compared species Douglas-fir (pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (pinus ponderosa) and lodgepole pine (pinus contorta var. latifolia). Douglas-fir foliar nutrient concentrations were higher than ponderosa pine or lodgepole pine. The addition of nitrogen alone tends to cause a decrease in foliar potassium levels for all the species examined. Increases in nitrogen foliar concentrations were consistently higher on the nitrogen alone treatments than the nitrogen plus sulphur treatments.","Shaw, T.M.; Moore, J.A.",1994-01-01,,research; forest management; fertilizer; timber (lumber);,research; forest management; fertilizer; timber (lumber);,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Shaw, T.M., J.A.

Principal Components Analysis of Tree Stem Profiles,"The use of principal components analysis to study tree stem profiles was critically analyzed during 1085 destructively sampled Douglas-fir trees and 1260 simulated trees with known geometric shapes. Interpretation about the meaning of each principal component is provided and contrasted with others in the forestry literature. Nearly identical results with both the destructively sampled and simulated trees, along with certain theoretical consideratons, indicate that the principal components are related to tree form as opposed to tree profile or taper. Therefore, principal components analysis is a useful analytical tool for stratifying trees into different form groups.","Real, P.L.; Moore, J.A.; Newberry, J.D.",1989-07-14,,research;,research;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,Canadian Journal of Forest Research,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Real, P.L., J.A.

Nitrogen and Potassium Concentrations after Fertilization on Mixed Conifer Stands in North Central Washington,"Post fertilization foliar nitrogen and potassium concentrations and needle weights were examined for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menzeisii), lodgepole pine (pinus contorta) and ponderosa pine (pinus ponderosa) in north central Washington. Foliar nitrogen concentration was found to increase and foliar potassium concentration to remain the same or decrease following fertilization. Lodgepole pine showed the most efficient uptake for both nitrogen and potassium. Potassium to nitrogen ratios decreased following treatment. Needle weights for lodgepole pine  increased following fertilization. Foliar magnesium, boron, iron and zinc levels were also examined for lodgepole pine and ponderosa pine occurring on pumice soils versus glacial till soils. Response to treatment varied widely, but expected nutrient deficiencies due to pumice soils did not materialize except for lodgepole pine magnesium levels on untreated plots. Boron and iron showed unexpected increases on pumice soils following combined nitrogen and potassium treatment, leading us to suspect that some other soil layer may underlie the pumice soil.","Garrison, M.T.; Moore, J.A.",1995-04-01,,research; forest management; fertilizer; timber (lumber);,research; forest management; fertilizer; timber (lumber);,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Garrison, M.T., and J.A.

Effects of Nitrogen Fertilization on Growth of Grand Fir and Douglas-Fir Stands in Northern Idaho,"A study of nitrogen fertilization response in thinned and unthinned stands of grand fir (Abies grandis) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) in northern Idaho showed that the application of one urea nitrogen treatment applied at a rate of 200 lb N/ac resulted in a significantly higher average basal area growth over a 6-year post-treatment period. Nitrogen fertilization also resulted in a significant height increment increase over the same period. Fourteen years after treatment, fertilization had increased average tree size, in terms of total cubic volume, by 14% in unthinned and by 23% in thinned stands. A comparison of thinned and unthinned stands suggested an increase in tree size (&gt;300%) over the same period without significant reduction in average total cubic volume per acre. Patterns of stand development were altered by nitrogen fertilization.","Shafii, B.; Moore, J.A.; Olson, J.R.",1989-04-01,,research; forest management; fertilizer; timber (lumber);,research; forest management; fertilizer; timber (lumber);,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,Western Journal of Applied Forestry,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Shafii, B., J.A.

A Summary of Geologic Information used by the Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative to Estimate Potassium Content of Rock,"The IFTNC currently classifies parent materials based on four rock types: Basic-Igneous (Basaltic), Acid- Igneous (Granitic), Metasedimentary, and Mixed (glacial till). In order to further clarify health-related issues and their potential association with parent materials, a more specific classification of parent materials according to content of certain critical elements, especially potassium (K) would be helpful. Such a classification system should allow us to categorize the rock types found on geologic maps and publications according to element content and contribution to soil-available nutrient supply. The purpose of this paper is to present a classification of rock types based on K content; the discussion of rock contribution to soil-available K supply will be discussed separately. The following classification system was developed based on a literature review of basic mineralogical, petrographical, geochemical and geological information.","Garrison, M.",1996-04-01,,research;,research;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Geology - Nutrition and Productivity,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Garrison, M.T. 1996.

Two Year Basal Area Response to N and K Fertilization for Mixed Conifer Stands in North Central Washington,"Two years after fertilization, overall gross basal area response was 31.1% on those plots receiving the 200 lb. nitrogen (N) acre and 33.8% on those plots receiving 200 lb. nitrogen plus 200 lb. potassium (K) acre. Results from this study show that response was different by species, with lodgepole pine expressing higher absolute and relative response than ponderosa pine, western larch or mixed conifer for both treatments. Sites that were predominately ponderosa pine expressed low growth but did show good relative (percent) response to the treatments. Western larch and mixed species sites expressed good absolute response. Gross Basal area response was similar to foliar nutrient and needle weight response.

Individual-Tree Diamter Growth Models for Quantifying Within-Stand Response to Nitrogen Fertilization,"Diameter-increment models for nitrogen-fertilized stands were developed using data from permanent research plots in northern Idaho. The equations partially resembled PROGNOSIS model diameter growth formulations. Results indicated that both initial tree size and initial stand density produced significant interactions with treatment to explain an individual tree's response to fertilization. Larger trees in a stand showed more fertilization response than smaller trees. Furthermore, individual trees in low-density stands showed more fertilization response than those growing in high density stands. These diameter increment predictive equations were formulated to be compatible with individual-tree distance-independent simulation models.","Shafii, B.; Moore, J.A.; Newberry, J.D.",1990-01-29,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Biometrics and Modeling,Canadian Journal of Forest Research,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Shafii, B., J.A.

Spatial Variation in Conifer Foliar Nutrient Concentrations,"The spatial distribution of foliar nutrient concentrations in Douglas-fir and grand fir species was investigated in a study conducted in northern Idaho. Mensurational data were collected from 55 Douglas-fir and 69 grand fir individual trees from 14 one-half acre plots. Foliage samples from the third whorl ofeach tree were taken, and tree positions were mapped using a Global Positional System (GPS). A stochastic modeling method, the sequential conditional Gaussian simulation, was used to study tree volume and foliar nutrient flow dynamics. Spatial variations were analyzed between individual tree measurements and nitrogen, potassium and boron concentrations under different fertilization treatments. The study showed that there are species differences in the distribution of foliage nutrient concentrations and tree biomass. Potassium and boron concentrations were lower in plots treated with high nitrogen rates. Boron concentration values were higher on the untreated plot.","Avila, R.A.; Miller, S.M.; Moore, J.A.",1996-10-03,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Biometrics and Modeling,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Avila, R.A., S.M.

A Summary of Geologic Information used by the Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative to Estimate Potassium Content of Rocks,"The IFTNC currently classifies parent materials based on four rock types: Basic-Igneous (Basaltic), Acid- Igneous (Granitic), Metasedimentary, and Mixed (glacial till). In order to further clarify health-related issues and their potential association with parent materials, a more specific classification of parent materials according to content of certain critical elements, especially potassium (K) would be helpful. Such a classification system should allow us to categorize the rock types found on geologic maps and publications according to element content and contribution to soil-available nutrient supply. The purpose of this paper is to present a classification of rock types based on K content; the discussion of rock contribution to soil-available K supply will be discussed separately. The following classification system was developed based on a literature review of basic mineralogical, petrographical, geochemical and geological information.","Garrison, M.T.",1996-03-01,,research;,research;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Geology - Nutrition and Productivity,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Garrison, M.T. 1996.

Representing Growth Response to Fertilization in the Prognosis Model for Stand Development,"Capability to represent effects of fertilization has been added to the Prognosis Model for Stand Development. As implemented in version 6, the extension is calibrated only for applications of 200 lb nitrogen applied in the form of urea. Direct and indirecteffects are based on growth 10 years after treatment for diameter effects, and 6 years after treatment for height effects. Mortality is not affected in the model. After 10 years, only indirect effects are represented through the normal dynamics of the Prognosis Model. Control of timing is provided through a keyword, the parameters of which are documented in this note.","Stage, A.R.; Crookston, N.L.; Shafii, B.; Moore, J.A.; Olson, J.",1990-08-01,,research; statistics;,research; statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Biometrics and Modeling,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Stage, A.S., N.L.

Disaggregating Stand Volume Growth To Individual Trees,"A disaggregation function, relative size-growth (RSG) function, is proposed and developed to distribute stand volume growth to a list of individual trees. The relative size-growth (RSG) function is formulated as a quadratic equation relating relative tree growth to relative tree size in a stand. The shape of the RSG function is linear, convex, or concave depending on initial stand conditions and structure. A recursive system of equations is developed to predict the three coefficients of the RSG function using initial stand density, mean tree size and coefficient of variation of tree size distribution as predictor variables. This disaggregation function determines within-stand growth of individual trees and simulates stand development and dynamics. The RSG function provides a biologically based link between whole-stand and individual tree resolution models.","Zhang, L.; Moore, J.A.; Newberry, J.D.",1992-03-01,,research; statistics;,research; statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Biometrics and Modeling,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative. 1992.

Estimating Asymptotic Attributes of Forest Stands Based on Bio-Mathematical Rationales,"An approach for estimating asymptotic stand yield, basal area and number of stems per unit area is proposed. Available forest stand growth data are used to establish the reciprocal equation of Competition-Density (C-D) effect and develop equations relating the coefficients of C-D effect to stand top height. Asymptotic stand yield, basal area and number of stems are derived based on bio-mathematical rationales and expressed as functions of asymptotic top height. Asymptotic top height can be obtained for different site qualities and/or habitat types by evaluating a height growth model in the limit as age approaches infinity. Estimated asymptotes can be utilized to parameterize sigmoid-shaped growth functions (e.g. Richards growth model) for developing forest growth and yield models.","Shang, L.; Moore, J.A.; Newberry, J.D.",1992-03-02,,research; data modeling; statistics;,research; data modeling; statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Biometrics and Modeling,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Zhang, et al.

"Fertilization Response by Interior Forests: When, Where, and How Much?","Interest in tree nutrition and the use of fertilizers in forests of the interior West has grown over the last 20 years. Large-scale fertilizer trials have been established to estimate growth response for Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and lodgepole pine. Current research focuses on where and why fertilizer response is obtained and how fertilization interacts with other forest management activities. Nitrogen is the major growth-limiting nutrient in these forests. For Douglas-fir, gross volume growth responses to 224 kg N /ha may average up to 25% during the first six years following fertilization. Similar treatments in ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine have produced a 30% volume response in five and six years, respectively. Response has been shown to vary across parent materials and soil types; it is usually less on sites with high levels of mineralizable nitrogen in the soil, high foliar nitrogen concentrations, or high site index. Good response to nitrogen fertilization has been linked to vegetation control in very young stands and to stocking control in older stands. Nitrogen fertilization may increase mortality rates and the incidence of pest problems. While other nutrients usually do not produce a significant growth response when applied singly, response to nitrogen may be limited by natural or induced deficiencies of other nutrients. Lack of sulfur, boron, or copper can reduce growth response to nitrogen in lodgepole pine; low potassium levels may have a similar effect in Douglas-fir; and addition of other nutrients, primarily sulfur, has increased response to nitrogen in ponderosa pine.","Mika, P.G.; Moore, J.A.; Brockley, R.P.; Powers, R.F.",1992,,,,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Mika, P.G., J.A.

"Effects of Fertilization on Epicuticular Wax Morphology of Needle Leaves of Douglas Fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Pinaceae)","Fertilized stands of Pseudotsuga menziesii were found to have glaucous needles. We investigated the morphological and quantitative characteristics of the epicuticular waxes of needles of fertilized and control trees. Glaucousness was caused by ornate tubular epicuticular wax. Dipping needles in chloroform, which dissolves waxes, eliminated the glaucous appearance. Based on cryostage scanning electron microscopic observations, the epicuticular waxes in the nonstomatal region were much more ornate on the needles of the fertilized trees (experimental needles) than in unfertilized trees (control needles). The stomatal region in both experimental and control needles showed similarly ornate waxes. Quantities of waxes were similar in experimental and control needles. The glaucousness was not the result of greater quantities of wax; rather, fertilization altered wax morphology in the nonstomatal regions.","Chiu, S.; Anton, L.H.; Ewers, F.W.; Hammerschmidt, R.; Pregitzer, K.S.",1992,,research; botany; trees; fertilizer;,research; botany; trees; fertilizer;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,American Journal of Botany,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Chiu, S., L.H.

Other elements may be limiting but not as commonly as these two. Forest fertilization can alleviate these deficiencies resulting in trees that should be more resistant to insects and diseases.

Third Five Year Study Plan for the Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative,"Document outlining the plan for the IFTNC for the next 5 years, it includes a goal statement and an experiment with the following Preface: Previous results from IFTNC Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine experiments suggest a link between nutrition, particularly potassium nutrition, and insect and disease pests. Mortality rates in the Douglas-fir trials were significantly higher instands with poor pre-treatment foliar K status after application of 400 lbs. of N/ Ac. lnterestingly, the most common mortality causes in this K status/ treatment category were root rots and bark beetles. Results from the Montana ponderosa pine experiment showed that N only treated plots experienced higher mortality rates, producing a net loss in volume growth after 4 years. Conversely, N + K treated plots showed less mortality than control plots. The net volume growth   effect associated with adding K was highly significant. Mortality on the N only plots was six times as great as control plot mortality; over 80% of it resulting from bark beetle activity N+ K plots showed less mortality than control plots with no bark beetle mortality.",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative,1993-08-18,James A.

Effects of Fertilization and Herbicide Treatments on Pole and Young Stand Growth in Montana,"The fertilizer, herbicide, and combination treatments generally had a significant positive effect on tree growth, although response was quite variable between sites. sometimes the response was very large approaching 70% for some sites. Generally N-P-K fertilizer only treatment was most effective in the larger (pole) sized stands, while the herbicide treatment was not. The results were the opposite for the young stands, the herbicide treatment produced better response than fertilizer only  treatment. However, the combined fertilizer and herbicide treatment was sometimes the best treatment for the young stands. Interestingly, similar to the IFTNC results, foliar KIN ratio (actually the change in the ratio) was a significant predictor of response. If the KIN ratio decreased (usually  associated with the fertilizer only treatment) following treatment, then response was negative; however, if the KIN ratio increased (always associated with the combined treatment), then growth response was positive and substantially so.","Mandzak, J.M.; Moore.

Forest Fertility Field Day,"Forest fertility is currently one of the hottest issues in forest science. We are constantly learning more about forest fertility and its relationship to forest growth and health.  Forest Fertility Field Day will start indoors with UI Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative staff orienting the group to the current state of knowledge regarding forest fertility, growth and health. An overview of current research on geology and its apparent effects on forest nutritional status will also be introduced. The program concludes with a field trip where participants will see forest health conditions in the field, and view first hand some of the relationships between forest health and underlying geology.","Moore, J.A.; Mika, P.G.; Shaw, T.M.; Garrison, M.T.;",1996,,schedules (time plans); tours (journeys);,schedules (time plans); tours (journeys);,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Moore, J.A., P.G.

Influence of Soil Parent Material on the Nutrition and Health of Established Conifer Stands in the Inland Northwest,"Initial efforts of the Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) concentrated on studying the effect of nitrogen fertilization on Douglas-fir (Psuedotsuga menziesii var. glauca) growing in the inland Northwest (eastern Oregon, Eastern Washington, Idaho, and western Montana). The lFTNC established ninety-four experimental sites in managed, second growth Douglas-fir stands.

Douglas-fir and Ponderosa Pine Growth and Biochemical Response to Various Multinutrient Fertilizer Treatments,"Nearly all forest sites in the Inland Northwest are nutrient deficient, usually for nitrogen (N) but sometimes other nutrients as well. Furthermore, a single nutrient limitation cannot always be perceived and there is evidence that shows conifer growth and health may strongly depend on the interaction and availability of several mineral nutrients. In this paper, results are presented from two Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) studies designed to investigate Inland Northwest Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine seedling nutrition as inftuenced by various nutrient treatments.  Results from IFTNC studies have shown that N alone or in conjunction with other mineral nutrient treatments significantly altered foliar nutrient levels, growth rates and carbon allocation patterns in Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine seedlings. As expected, growth was significantly higher for seedlings receiving N amendments than for those seedlings receiving low or no N in the treatment mix. Douglas-fir seedling allocation to needles was the same between the high and low N treatments, but allocation to roots increased while allocation to stem decreased under low N supply.  The effects of the N and potassium (K) treatments on Douglas-fir seedling root production of soluble sugar, starch, phenolic and protein precipitable tannin were observed in this study. Root storage compounds such as starch were reduced in Douglas-fir seedlings receiving the high N treatments, whereas secondaiy defensive compounds like phenolics and tannins were reduced in plants receiving low K treatments.  Caliper growth in ponderosa pine seedlings grown under different multi nutrient treatments showed significant differences between application rates, fertilizer release rates, and time of sampling. Seedlings receiving the 15 gram multi-nutrient treatment tended to show higher caliper growth response than seedlings receiving either the 5 or 30 gram treatments. Overall, caliper response after bud set in the fall tended to be higher for those seedlings receiving the medium release rate fertilizer treatment compared to those receiving the slow or fast release rate fertilizers.","Shaw, T.M.",1997,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Seedling Growth and Nutrition,"Department of Forest Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Shaw, T.M., 1997.

Response of Planted Ponderosa Pine Trees to Slow Release Fertilizers,"Nutrient availability has long been recognized as a limiting factor to plant growth (Luxmoore et al. 1993). In the Pacific Northwest, of the elements needed for tree growth, nitrogen is the only one that is consistently deficient in the forests of the Northwest (Cole, et al., 1992). Foliage samples collected from 90 fertilizer trials in Douglas-fir scattered across eastern Washington, northeastern Oregon, Idaho and western Montana showed nitrogen concentrations of unfertilized trees to be quite low throughout the area (Mika and Moore, 1990). Foliar analysis has also shown severe to very severe nitrogen deficiencies to be common in lodgepole pine stands throughout the interior of British Columbia (Ballard, 1986) and in many ponderosa pine (Powers et al. 1988) and true fir (Powers, 1981) stands in California and Oregon. No other nutrients have been found generally lacking over such large areas and wide range of conditions. Since early work by the College of Forestry, University of Washington, in the1950's, wide-scale testing with nitrogen has been used to develop response predictions. Currently, however, most information on application rates has been based on broadcast application of soluble nitrogen sources. Very little or no information is available on effects of slow release sources on growth of ponderosa pine, especially using a dibble technique. Therefore, the objectives of this study are:  1) to determine the optimum rate of a complete fertilizer to assure rapid tree establishment and early development during the first four years following outplanting;  2) to evaluate the effects of different nutrient release characteristics on plant performance, especially on the root system and  3) to determine correlation of nutrient concentrations from tissue analysis with nutrient application rate and seedling growth rates.  The experiment, if successful, will provide a practically economic and efficient fertilization method to ensure rapid growth and a higher nutrient uptake rates of after planting ponderosa pine.","Fan, Z.; Moore, J.A.",1998-04-14,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Seedling Growth and Nutrition,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Fan, Z., J.A.

Foliar Nutrient and Growth Response of Mixed-Conifer Stands on the Okanogan and Umatilla National Forests to Three Fertilization Treatments,"This paper summarizes results from two studies evaluating nutrient uptake in mixed conifer stands following fertilization with three nutrient combinations. The studies were conducted in northeastern Oregon and in central Washington by the Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (lFTNC) in cooperation with the Umatilla and Okanogan National Forests. Four tree species were evaluated for nutrient uptake: Pseudotsuga menzeisii (Douglas-fir), Abies grandis (grand fir). Pinus eontona (lodgepole pine), and Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine). The fertilization treatments were nitrogen (N), nitrogen with potassium (K), and nitrogen with sulfur (5). One intent of the research was to determine whether fertilizing these stands would help basten the rotation and bring them into production sooner by increasing growth rates and decreasing mortality rates. Another objective was to examine how various species respond to fertilization when growing together in a mixture in the same stand. Most previous fertilization trials have been conducted in relatively pure, single species stands and involved only nitrogen.","Garrison, M.T.; Moore, J.A.; Shaw, T.M.; Mika, P.G.",1998-04-01,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Garrison, M.T., J.A.

Root Chemistry of Douglas-fir Seedlings Grown Under Different Nitrogen and Potassium Treatments,"Chemical changes in roots of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. g/auca (Bessn.) Franco) seedlings were induced under optimal and deficient levels of nitrogen (N) and potassium (K). Concentrations of sugar, starch, phenolics and proteinprecipitable tannins were significantly different by treatment in the roots of four-year-old Douglas-fir seedlings under varied Nand K regimes. Root tip starch concentrations were significantly higher and sugar concentrations were lower in plants receiving the low-N treatments. Seedlings receiving the high N-low K treatment had significantly lower concentrations of phenolics and tannins and lower ratios of defensive compounds to carbohydrates than seedlings receiving the high potassium treatments. Samples taken from two locations on the root system show that concentrations of all storage and  defensive compounds were substantially higher in the root collar than in the root tips. Due to lower within tissue variation, we recommend sampling at root tips to better detect treatment differences. This study shows that N levels affect starch concentrations in the roots, while K levels affect root phenolic and tannin concentrations.","Shaw, T.M.; Moore, J.A.; Marshall, J.D.",1998-04-01,,research; roots (plant components); fertilizer; statistics;,research; roots (plant components); fertilizer; statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Health and Nutrition,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Shaw, T.M., J.A.

Ponderosa Pine Response to Nitrogen or Nitrogen Plus Potassium Fertilization - Annual Report,"In 1985, the Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) established 10 nitrogen (N) fertilization trials in stands dominate by Ponderosa pine. The ponderosa pine trials were located throughout northeastern Oregon and central Washington and were an expansion of IFTNC Douglas-fir N fertilization trials established in the early 1980's. The focus of these fertilization trials was to study nutrition of commercial forests in the Intermountain Northwest, with the majority of the effort on studying the effect of N fertilization on growth and survival. In addition, evidence from IFTNC Douglas-fir trials (Mika and Moore 1990) and other research from the Inland Northwest suggested that elements other than N, particularly potassium (K), may also be limiting. In 1987, IFTNC members established 6 additional ponderosa pine trials in Montana to study the effects of N and K fertilization on tree growth and survival.

Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Klickitat Re-fertilization Progress Report,"In the fall of 1990, the IFTNC established six fertilization study trials in the Klickitat area of south central Washington. Three IFTNC members were involved in the establishment ofthese study trails. Cooperative members include: Champion Timberlands, Longview Fibre and Washington Dept. ofNatural Resources. The original fertilization trails were designed to study the effects ofnitrogen (N) and potassium (1K) fertilization on tree growth and survival. Tree fertilization response (basal area and cubic volume response over that ofthe controls) was monitored every two years and response results were summarized. Six-year results showed that periodic volume growth response for each two-year period since fertilization gradually decreased over time. However, significant responses were seen on individual sites by parent material types. Examination ofthe six-year results and re-evaluation oftree nutritional needs in this area prompted the cooperators to further investigate fertilization response in the Klickitat area with a refertilization of the existing 1990 installations.","Shaw, T.M.; Moore, J.A.",1998-08-04,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Shaw, T.M., J.A.

Progress Report: Forest Fertilization Effects on the Understory Community,"Most forest soils in the Intermountain  Northwest have nutrient deficiencies  of some kind, especially nitrogen. Overstory conifer trees respond favorably  following fertilization in the Intermountain  Northwest.  However, knowledge of fertilization  effects on understory vegetation growth in mixed-conifer  stands in the Intermountain  Northwest is minimal.  The effects of overstory density on understory vegetation response to fertilization in the Intermountain Northwest is also limited. Information about whether fertilization  of understory vegetation causes species composition. species diversity, and wildlife habitat to change through time in mixed-conifer stands in the Intermountain  Northwest is scarce. Knowledge of the long term effects of fertilization  treatments on understory vegetation characteristics in the Intermountain Northwest is lacking. Fertilization may not produce statistically significant responses in understory vegetation growth until several years after application. This study is an attempt to quantify affects a short time after application and to establish monitoring plots. The IFTNC plans to use these study areas for a long-term assessment. Understory vegetation may show more response immediately after fertilization or more response several years after fertilization.","Vanderschaaf, C.",1998-04-01,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Vegetation Management - Nutrition and Productivity,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"VanderSchaaf, Curtis, 1998.

Height-Diameter Equations for Ten Tree Species in the Inland Northwest,"Individual tree height-diameter equations were developed for ten major species in the inland Northwest. The Wykoff function in the Stand Prognosis Model and the Lundqvist function were fit to data which included many large-sized trees. The two models fit the data equally well for all species. Prediction results using the existing Prognosis equation, the refitted Wykoff function, and the Lundqvist function showed that the three models predicted similar heights for trees of small diameter. However, both the refitted Wykoff function and the Lundqvist function predicted larger tree heights for trees with dbh greater than 20 in. for most species. The estimated heights for tree diameters of 70 or 80 in. from  the Lundqvist function were closer to the observed """"asymptotic"""" tree heights than the other two. The Lundqvist function showed lower prediction errors for the validation data for the majority of the tree species, especially for large-sized trees.","Moore, J.A.; Zhang, L.; Stuck, D.",1996,,research; trees; statistics;,research; trees; statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Biometrics and Modeling,Western Journal of Applied Forestry,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Moore, J.A., L.

Biomass Allocation of Planted Container-Grown Ponderosa Pine Seedlings with Controlled-Release Fertilizer Incorporated in the Root Plug,"Three controlled-release fertilizers (fast release (FR), moderate release (MR) and slow release (SR were incorporated in the growing media at rates of 0.8, 1.6 or 3.2 grams per seedling at the time of sowing as supplements to nursery supplied soluble fertilizer. Effects on seedling biomass allocation of the """"160/90"""" container ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Doug. ex Laws) were evaluated in the field. Two years after outplanting, fertilization significantly increased foliage, stem, root and total biomass of ponderosa pine seedlings, but did not change foliage, stem and root dry weight ratios and shoot/root ratios. Fertilization changed height/caliper ratios of ponderosa pine seedlings. For small calipers 20mm), fertilized seedlings were taller than unfertilized seedlings of the same caliper; however, for larger calipers (&gt;20 mm), fertilized seedlings were shorter than unfertilized seedlings of the same caliper. Caliper was more strongly related to total and component biomass of ponderosa pine than was height. The strong association between caliper and biomass provides an efficient way to measure fertilizer treatment effects on biomass for future studies.","Fan, Z.; Moore, J.A.; Wenny, D.L.",1999-12-01,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Seedling Growth and Nutrition,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Fan, Z., J.A.

Root Chemistry of Mature Douglas-fir Differs by Habitat Type in the Inland Northwest,"This paper describes root biochemical characteristics of naturally regenerated Douglas-fir trees growing on a wide variety of sites in the inland Northwest. Roots of trees growing on dry, warm Douglas-fir habitat series had significantly greater concentrations of sugar and tannins, higher tannin/suagar ratios, and significantly lower phenolic concentrations and phenolic/sugar ratios than the roots of Douglas-fir trees growing on grand fir habitat series or western red cedar habitat series. Possible links between Douglas-fir root biochemical characteristics and susceptibility to root disease, particularly Armillaria, and tree resistance to drought are discussed.","Moore, J.A.; Mika, P.G.; Shaw, T.M.",1999-03-01,,research; roots (plant components); statistics;,research; roots (plant components); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Health Regional Fertilization Trials,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Moore, J.A., P.G.

Comparison of Foliar Nutrient Concentration Results and Protocol between Three Laboratories,"Foliar nutrient analysis results and laboratory analysis protocol were compared for three laboratories used by the IFTNC. Analysis of variance showed significant differences between laboratories for the same sample tissue. In addition, even though all three laboratories use ICP instrumentation, protocol techniques for preparing the foliage samples for analysis differ between laboratories. Various standards and internal checks are used routinely by each laboratory. It appears that the techniques used to digest and prepare the foliage samples are the main sources of variation between laboratories.","Shaw, T.M.; Moore, J.A.",1999-03-01,,research; research laboratories; methodology;,research; research laboratories; methodology;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Shaw, T.M., J.A.

IFTNC - Forest Foliar Nutrient Analysis Vector Excell,"Vector analysis is a foliar graphical technique used to compare plant growth, nutrient concentrations and nutrient content. It is a useful diagnostic tool to determine nutritional status of trees in response to silvicultural prescriptions such as forest fertilization. Vector analysis has been used over the past few decades to examine plant responses to various treatments. More recently, the IFTNC has used foliar vector analysis to interpret experimental forest nutrient status and tree growth response.  IFTNC staff, graduate students, and associates developed Vector Excell. Vector Excell was written within Microsoft Excel Visual Basic Editor and runs in a PC (IBM compatible) environment.  This paper covers Vector Excell installation, data entry and operation. Foliar data collection and foliar vector interpretation is the responsibility of the user and not the IFTNC, although the IFTNC can serve as advisees on these matters.

The Effect of Nitrogen Fertilization and Rock Type on Individual Tree Mortality,"An individual tree mortality model for nitrogen fertilized Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. gIauca (Beissn.) Franco) stands was developed using data from permanent research plots located throughout the inland Northwest. The proposed linear logistic model included the following independent variables: a set of dummy variables for the 5 rock types, a set of dummy variables for the 3 nitrogen fertilizer treatments, diameter at breast height, crown ratio, number of trees per hectare, and relative rank of tree size, defined by basal area in larger trees over basal area per ha. The results show that nitrogen fertilization and rock type significantly affect individual tree mortality. Trees growing on granitic and meta-sedimentary rocks exhibited greater probabilities of mortality than did those growing on other rocks. The probabilities of mortality for trees growing on sedimentary rocks were very low. The probabilities of tree monality increased with increasing nitrogen fertilizer application rates. Finally, nitrogen fertilization response ratios for annual probability of tree mortality were estimated based on the mortality model. The response ratios were nearly constant (about 1.54) across a range of tree diameters for all rock types with the 224 kg N treatment. The response ratios were also nearly constant (about 2.50) across a range of tree diameters for all rock types with the 448 kg N treatment.","Shen, G.; Hatch, C.R.; Moore, J.A.",1999-12-01,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Geology - Nutrition and Productivity,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Shen, G., C.R.

The Effect of Habitat Type and Rock Type on Individual Tree Basal Area Growth Response to Nitrogen Fertilization,"Individual tree basal area increment models for nitrogen fertilized stands were developed using data from permanent research plots located throughout the Inland Northwest. Results show that tree size, stand density, habitat type, and rock type significantly interact to affect individual tree basal area growth response to nitrogen fertilization. Small trees with high basal area in larger trees growing on moist habitat types and all rock types, except meta-sedimentary, exhibited greater relative response than larger trees with low basal area in larger trees growing in the same stand. Further, small trees with high basal area in larger trees growing on dry sites or on meta-sedimentary rocks showed less relative response than larger trees with low basal area in larger trees. Incorporating the new equations into individual tree growth and yield simulators would provide better representation of N fertilization response differences within a stand.","Shen, G.; Hatch, C.R.; Moore, J.A.",1999-01-01,,research; data modeling; statistics;,research; data modeling; statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Geology - Nutrition and Productivity,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Shen, G., J.A.

The greatest understory response to fertilization occurred in low density overstory stands. One additional cattle Animal Unit Month (AUM) can be produced per acre, one year following treatment, in stands with overstory basal area less than 50 ft.2/ac. One additional white-tailed deer equivalent AUM can be produced in stands with less than 75 ft.2/ac. overstory basal area.

Understanding the Interactions between Vegetation Control and Fertilization in Young Plantations: Southern Pine Plantations in the Southeast USA,"Historically, the practice of silviculture has focussed on controlling the composition, quantity, and structure of forest vegetation and the maintenance of site quality. As forest plantations have become important sources of fiber, fuel, and structural material, this custodial role has given way to active intervention to improve both plant and soil resources. Forest managers are finally recognizing that intensive plantation silviculture is like agronomy; both the plant and the soil need to be actively managed to optimize production. Silvicultural treatments including vegetation control and fertilization can dramatically effect site resource availability and the crop trees' ability to acquire and utilize these resources. The key to optimizing production is to use the best genetic material available and to provide resources in quantities sufficient to allow the trees' genetic potential to be realized. Effective manipulation of the genetic and site resources requires an understanding of what resources limit forest production, how these resources are affected by silvicultural treatment, and how crop trees may differ in their ability to acquire and utilize these resources. Fortunately, our understanding of the physiological and ecological processes regulating forest production has greatly increased during the last decade.  It is now generally accepted that much of the variation in wood production can be accounted for by variation in light interception. (Cannell 1989, Landsberg and Gower 1997, Linder 1987). Light interception is principally a function of the amount of leaf area and the duration of leaf area display. Empirical data from field studies with several conifer and broad-leaved species have shown that leaf area and consequently wood production are below optimum levels (Figure 1, Albaugh et al. 1998, Allen and Albaugh 1999, Benson et al. 1992, Colbert et al. 1990, Pereira et al. 1994, Snowdon and Benson 1992, Vose and Allen 1988). Low nutrient availability is a principal factor causing suboptimal levels of leaf area in many temperate humid areas (Albaugh et al 1998, Colbert et al. 1990). Low soil water availability and high vapor pressure deficits have also been shown to  adversely affect leaf area in areas with growing season water deficits (Benson et al. 1992, Hennessey et al. 1992, Pereira et al. 1994).  The variation in production per unit of leaf area (referred to as growth or leaf area efficiency) can also contribute to the variation in production. Growth efficiency can vary due to differences in photosynthetic efficiency, respiration, and partitioning to various biomass components. Improved nutrient and water availability has been shown to increase photosynthetic efficiency (Linder 1987) and aboveground productivity proportionally more than belowground productivity in stand-level studies (Albaugh et al. 1998, Allen and Albaugh 1999, Gower et al. 1994).","Allen, H.L.; Albaugh, T.J.",2000-10-18,,research; forest management;,research; forest management;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,"Department of Forest Soils at ESALQ / Univ. of San Paulo, Brazil",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Allan, H.L. and T.J.

"Effect of Root Plug Incorporated Controlled-Release Fertilizer upon Two-Year Survival, Growth and Nutrient Status of Planted Ponerosa Pine Seedlings","Three controlled-release fertilizers (fast release (FR), moderate release (MR) and slow release (SR)) were incorporated in the root plug at rates of0.8, 1.6 or 3.2 grams per seedling at the time of sowing as supplements to nursery supplied soluble fertilizer. Effects on seedling growth, survival and foliar nutrient status of the """"160/90"""" container ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Doug. ex Laws) were evaluated after outplanting. At the end of the second growing season, fertilized seedlings had significantly greater caliper and height than unfertilized seedlings. Fertilization significantly increased relative height growth rate, but did not significantly increase relative caliper growth rate. Most treatments had lower caliper growth rates than the controls. The differences between the 3.2 grams ofMR or SR fertilizer treatments and the controls were statistically significant. Height growth response was attributable to fertilizer doses rather than fertilizer types. The 3.2 grams of MR or SR fertilizer treatments produced significantly higher mortality (55 and 36 %, respectively) than the controls. The mortality was strongly correlated with root growth potential. Foliar N and Mo concentrations were significantly influenced by fertilization during the first growing season. During the second growing season, foliar Cu, Fe and K concentrations were found to be deficient or nearly deficient even after fertilization.","Fan, Z.; Moore, J.A.; Shafii, B.",2000-03-01,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Seedling Growth and Nutrition,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Fan, Z., J.A.

"Growth, Biomass Allocation and Root Growth Potential of Container-Grown Ponderosa Pine Seedlings with Controlled-Release Fertilizer Incorporated in the Root Plug","Prior to sowing seeds, three controlled-release fertilizers (fast release (FR), moderate release (MR) and slow release (SR were incorporated into the growing media at rates of 0.8, 1.6 or 3.2 grams as supplements to nursery supplied soluble fertilizer to grow ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Doug. ex Laws) seedlings in the greenhouse. At lifting, the caliper, height and total dry weight of fertilized """"160/90"""" seedlings ranged from 114 to 129%, 107 to 121% and 130 to 195% larger than those ofthe unfertilized seedlings, respectively. Needle biomass was affected more than stems or roots by the fertilization treatments. The 0.8 grams ofFR or SR fertilizer treatments significantly increased ponderosa pine seedling root growth potential (RGP) compared to the controls. Toxicity from continuous nutrient release during cold storage resulted in much lower RGP for the 3.2 grams ofMR or SR fertilizer treatments. The best dosage for caliper and height growth was 0.8 grams for FR fertilizer, 2.2 and 2.3 grams for MR fertilizer, and 1.9 and 2.0 grams for SR fertilizer, respectively. Lower application rates and shorter fertilizer release periods should be used with these small containers to prevent root damage when cold storage is required before outplanting.","Fan, Z.; Moore, J.A.; Shafii, B.",2000,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Seedling Growth and Nutrition,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Fan, Z., J.A.

Foliar Nutrient and Tree Growth Response of Mixed-conifer Stands to Three Fertilization Treatments in Northeast Oregon and North Central Washington,"The results of two studies evaluating nutrient uptake in mixed-conifer stands following fertilization are reported. The four species examined were Douglas-fir, grand fir, lodgepole pine and ponderosa pine. The fertilization treatments were 224 kg ha-1 nitrogen, 224 kg ha-1 nitrogen plus 112 kg ha-1 sulfur, and 224 kg ha-1 nitrogen plus 190.4 kg ha-1 potassium. Foliar nutrient concentrations, contents and ratios were analyzed, as well as four-year volume response. Douglas-fir showed both N and S deficiencies in control foliage samples, and produced significant growth response to the N + S treatment, but not to the N-alone treatment. Grand fir also showed foliar N and S deficiencies, but produced significant growth response to both N and N + S fertilization. This suggests that grand fir was better able to utilize N than Douglas-fir even under S-limiting conditions. Lodgepole pine showed deficient foliar N and S concentrations, and produced significant volume responses to N and N + K fertilization. Lodgepole volume response to N + S fertilization was highly variable, and appeared to be site specific. Ponderosa pine did not show nutrient deficiencies for N or K, and did not respond significantly in either foliar K or S levels or in growth to N, N + K or N + S fertilization. This suggests that nutrient deficiency may not have been a factor limiting foliar nutrient response and growth for ponderosa pine.","Garrison, M.T.; Moore, J.A.; Shaw, T.M.; Mika, P.G.",1999-07-28,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,Forest Ecology and Management,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Garrison, M.T., J.A.

Eight Year Response to N and N+S Fertilization for the Umatilla Mixed Conifer Study in Northeast Oregon and Southeast Washington,"Eight study sites were established in 1991 on the Umatilla National Forest to study forest growth response to nitrogen and nitrogen-sulfur fertilization. The eight sites corresponded to four locations, Pomeroy, Pendleton, Ukiah and Heppner, which were arrayed in a linear fashion from northeast to southwest across the Forest. While this location effect was confounded with many other factors, it was an important blocking factor for analyses of fertilization growth response. However, it was difficult to identify which location factors influenced fertilization response. The more mature stands at Pomeroy and Pendleton were analyzed together, while the Ukiah and Heppner sites were analyzed separately. Overall, while both N and N+S showed positive growth responses, N+S provided the greatest eight-year volume response. This response was greatest for the mature stands at the Pomeroy and Pendleton study sites. A positive N+S response did occur at Heppner, but was only detectable in analysis of relative volume response. Ukiah did not show a significant fertilization response. Both Heppner and Ukiah were difficult to analyze and understand due to problems inherent in their small tree sizes and open-grown conditions, as well as to wide variation in initial conditions. Two-year periodic volume growth was also calculated and displayed for each of the four locations. Periodic fertilizer responses were strongest during the first two to six years of the study, and fertilizer effect has diminished to the point of being almost indiscernible during the most recent two-year period.","Garrison, M.T.; Moore, J.A.",2000-04-01,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Garrison, M.T., J.A.

Vector Diagnosis of Container-grown Ponderosa Pine Nutrient Status with Controlled-release Fertilizer Incorporated in the Root Plug,"Prior to sowing seeds, three controlled-release fertilizers (fast release (FR), moderate release (MR) and slow release (SR)) were incorporated in the growing media at rates of 0.8, 1.6 or 3.2 grams per seedling as supplements to nursery supplied soluble fertilizer. Effects on seedling foliar and root nutrient status of""""160/90"""" container ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Doug. ex Laws) in the greenhouse were evaluated using graphical vector analysis. Treatment FR-0.8 produced the largest increase in foliage mass (238%) and root mass (169%) of all treatments while maintaining a nearly """"steady-state"""" condition. The """"steady-state"""" vectors resulting from treatment FR-0.8 indicate that nutrients were supplied in sufficient amounts to support the higher growth rates and increased biomass accumulation compared to the controls since nutrient contents increased in proportion to biomass. Some slow release fertilizers applied at higher rates, when combined with the existing nursery fertilization schedules, produced seedlings with poor nutritional balance in both foliage and roots. These treatments were readily detected with nutrient vector analysis and the technique proved to be effective in assisting the development of nursery fertilization regimes.","Moore, J.A.; Fan, Z.",2000-03-01,,research; roots (plant components); trees; statistics;,research; roots (plant components); trees; statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Seedling Growth and Nutrition,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Moore, J.A. and Z.

Root Chemistry of Mature Douglas-fir Differs by Habitat Type in the Interior Northwestern United States,"Carbon compound concentrations in plant tissues depend on the environment in which plants grow. However, little is known about how these concentrations vary across a range of forest environmental conditions. Our study examined root tissue (phloem, cambium, phellum, and phelloderm) collected from naturally regenerated mature Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca [Bessn.] Franco) trees in eight stands on three habitat type series encompassing a range of temperature and moisture conditions. The objective was to determine root chemical composition (sugar, starch, phenol, and tannin) differences among the habitat types. Douglas-fir roots collected from dry, warm Douglas fir habitat types had sugar concentrations of 4% compared to 3% for roots from cool, moist habitat types. Root samples collected from Douglas-fir habitat types showed tannin concentrations about double those from grand fir or western redcedar habitat types. Phenol/tannin ratios for the cool, moist habitat types were about double those from warm, dry Douglas-fir habitat types. Roots sampled from western redcedar habitat types had phenol concentrations and phenol/sugar ratios more than 50% higher than those from Douglas-fir and grand fir habitat types. We speculate that root chemistry of Douglas-fir growing on Douglas-fir habitat types could make them more drought resistant but less disease resistant, while Douglas-fir growing on western redcedar types would be less drought resistant but more disease resistant. Douglas-fir growing on warm, dry sites allocated more carbon to tannin production and less to phenols.","Moore, J.A.; Mika, P.G.; Shaw, T.M.",2000-03-29,,research; roots (plant components); trees; statistics;,research; roots (plant components); trees; statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Health Regional Fertilization Trials,Forest Science,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Moore, J.A., P.G.

Variation in the Root Bark Chemistry of Douglas-fir,"Several studies have linked high phenolics:sugar ratios in the inner root bark tissue of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) to decreased susceptibility to Armillaria spp. While these studies have identified environmental factors that influence root chemistry, none have examined whether the phenolics:sugar ratio is genetically controlled. In this study, the effects of genetics and environment on Douglas-fir root bark chemistry were investigated. Significant differences in root bark  chemistry of 15-yr-old Douglas-fir were detected among 20 open-pollinated families and 2 sites in northern Idaho. Family, site and the family x site interaction were significant sources of variation in the concentrations of sugar, starch, protein-precipitable tannins, and phenolics as well as in the phenolics: sugar ratio. Single-tree narrow-sense and family heritability estimates revealed that 20-24% of the variation in the phenolics:sugar ratio can be attributed to genetic differences, while around 60% of the variation in sugar concentrations can be attributed to genetic differences. Family and individual narrow-sense heritability estimates for 12-yr height growth were 0.62 and 0.54, respectively. While the correlation between height and the phenolics:sugar ratio was not significant, three families above the seventieth percentile in height growth expressed above average phenolics: sugar ratios at both sites. Should a high phenolics:sugar ratio prove effective in selecting genotypes for resistance to Armillaria infection, these results suggest that it would be possible to do so without sacrificing families with superior height growth in a tree improvement program. Gains could be made even more efficiently by selecting for low sugar concentrations.","Myszewski, J.H.; Fins, L.; Moore, J.A.; Rust, M.; Mika, P.G.",2000-04-01,,research; roots (plant components); trees; statistics;,research; roots (plant components); trees; statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Health and Nutrition,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Myszewski, J.H., L.

"The Effect of Nitrogen Fertilization, Rock Type, and Habitat Type on Individual Tree Mortality","An individual tree mortality model for nitrogen fertilized Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca [Beissn.] Franco) stands was developed using data from permanent research plots located throughout the inland Northwest. The proposed linear logistic model included the following independent variables: a dummy variable for the two habitat types, a set of dummy variables for the five rock types, a set of dummy variables for the three N fertilizer treatments, diameter at breast height, crown ratio, and crown competition factor. The results show that N fertilization, rock type, and habitat type significantly affect individual tree mortality. The probabilities of tree mortality on fertilized plots were greater than those on control plots and increased with increasing N fertilizer application  rates. Trees growing on granitic and metasedimentary rocks had lower foliar potassium concentration and exhibited greater probabilities of mortality than did those growing on other rocks. The probabilities of mortality for trees growing on sedimentary rocks were very low. Moist sites had lower soil fertility and produced higher mortality rates than dry sites. Furthermore, the N fertilization response ratio, defined as the annual mortality probability of a fertilized tree over the annual mortality probability of a unfertilized tree with identical tree and stand characteristics, was estimated based on the mortality model. The response ratios were nearly constant (about 1.4) across a range of tree diameters for all rock types with the 224 kg N treatment. The response ratios were also nearly constant (about 2.1) across a range of tree diameters for all rock types with the 448 kg N treatment. Finally, the mortality prediction model passed a validation test on independent data not used in model development.","Shen, G.; Hatch, C.R.; Moore, J.A.",2000-07-28,,research; data modeling; fertilizer; statistics;,research; data modeling; fertilizer; statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Geology - Nutrition and Productivity,Forest Science,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Shen, G., J.A.

The Effect of Habitat Type and Rock Type on Individual Tree Basal Area Growth Response to Nitrogen Fertilization,"Individual tree basal area increment models for nitrogen fertilized stands were developed using data from permanent research plots located throughout the Inland Northwest. Results show that tree size, stand density, habitat type, and rock type significantly interact to affect individual tree basal area growth response to nitrogen fertilization. Suppressed trees growing on moist habitat types and all rock types, except metasedimentary, exhibited greater relative response than did dominant or codominant trees growing in the same stand. However, suppressed trees growing on dry sites or on soils derived from granite rocks did not show different relative response than dominant or codominant trees growing in the same stand. This study quantitatively demonstrates that individual tree competitive relationships are significantly affected by rock type. Rock types proved to be useful in representing broad differences in a site's nutrient environment. Incorporating the new equations into individual tree growth and yield simulators would provide better representation of N fertilization response differences within a stand.","Shen, G.; Hatch, C.R.; Moore, J.A.",2000-01-01,,research; data modeling; fertilizer; statistics;,research; data modeling; fertilizer; statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Geology - Nutrition and Productivity,Canadian Journal of Forest Research,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Shen, G., J.A.

The Effect of Multi-nutrient fertilization on Understory Plant Diversity,"This study examined multi-nutrient fertilization effects on understory vegetation diversity at eight forested locations in the inland Northwest. Percent canopy covered by understory plant species of three growth forms (shrubs, forbs, grasses) and total understory were determined over a two year period following treatment. Two diversity indices (Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson's index) were used to quantify multi-nutrient fertilization effects on understory plant diversity. Multi-nutrient fertilization prescribed to increase overstory tree growth did not typically reduce understory vegetation diversity, rather diversity increased following fertilization on some sites. Understory composition at the time of treatment greatly determined fertilizalion effects on diversiry as follows: 1) if most species in the plant community responded relatively the same after treatment then diversity was unchanged even though total biomass increase may have been large; 2) if a highly responsive species was abundant prior to treatment. then diversity decreased following fertilization; and 3) if a highly responsive species was relatively rare prior to treatment, then diversity increased following fertilization. Multi-nutrient forest fertilization generally did not affect understory plant diversity, but where changes did occur diversity increases were more common than decreases.","VanderSchaaf, C.L.; Moore, J.A.; Kingery, J.L.",2000-08-10,,research; shrubs; grasses (plants); fertilizer; statistics;,research; shrubs; grasses (plants); fertilizer; statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Vegetation Management - Nutrition and Productivity,Northwest Science Association,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"VanderSchaaf, C.L., J.A.

North Idaho Nutrition Guidelines by Rock Type,"This document was prepared as a guideline for foresters to use in determining appropriate nutrient management strategies for forest stands on various rock types in north Idaho and portions of northeastern Washington. The guidelines proposed in this document are based on both observational and experimental evidence compiled by the Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) since its inception in 1980.  Nine digital geologic maps covering most of north Idaho and portions of northeastern Washington were compiled for this report. A location map showing the maps used in this compilation is shown in Appendix A. Four of these maps, the Headquarters, Missoula West, Kookia and Hamilton 1:100000 quadrangles, are in preliminary form. Expect the map units to change over time. Stands in these areas MUST be field checked for rock type before proceeding with nutrient management decisions. A listing of all rock units from each of the nine maps was extracted, for a total of approximately 435 rock units. Each of these rock units was assigned to one of 59 lithology groups, labeled as 'LITH_GRP' A complete listing of rock units by map is shown in Appendix D, along with a brief description and the corresponding lithology grouping. Each rock unit was also assigned to one of four broad categories, labeled 'CATEGORY.' These four categories include extrusive/ basaltic rocks, intrusive/ granitic rocks, metamorphic rocks, and mixed rocks.  The following section of the report discusses nutrient management strategies for each rock category. Within each category, the guidelines are further subdivided based on the lithology groupings. These guidelines are based on the current state of knowledge regarding rocks and forest growth. We fully expect these guidelines to be further refined with additional experience and experimentation.  Caveats: Geology maps are a useful tool in forest management. However, the user must be aware that geology maps were not developed for use at the forest stand level. We have found the updated north Idaho geology maps to be very good for giving a general idea of the rocks likely to be found in a particular area, and often the maps are precise to the stand level. Nonetheless, foresters must always verify the rock type in the field before considering fertilization options. The information included in this report is intended only to provide general guidelines to be considered in the formulation of silvicultural prescriptions.","Garrison-Johston, M.T.; Moore, J.A.",2001-07-30,,research; geological maps; fertilizer; forest management;,research; geological maps; fertilizer; forest management;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Garrison-Johnston, M.T., and J.A.

An Analysis of Douglas-fir Beetle Outbreak Occurrence as Related to Geology on the Idaho Panhandle National Forests,"Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) is a native conifer species which is widely distributed throughout the inland northwest of the United States. This species occurs across a variety of site conditions, and may grow in pure stands or in combination with other tree species common to the area. Douglas-fir is one of the most important timber-producing species in the  region.  A number of insects and diseases affect Douglas-fir stands in the region. Most are endemic to the area and experience natural cycles of buildup and decline. During the late 1990's, an endemic insect known as the Douglas-fir beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins) began to increase to epidemic proportions throughout much of northern Idaho and northeastern Washington. This beetle burrows into the tree's bark and lays eggs. The adults and larvae then feed on the phloem, usually girdling and killing the tree (Hagle et al. 1987). During 1996 and 1997, an average of 51 ha/yr (125 ac) were affected by new Douglas-fir beetle attacks. By 1998 approximately 479 ha (1185 ac) were affected, and in 1999, aerial surveys indicated that 31,093 ha (76,830 ac) were impacted. These outbreaks caused great concern, due largely to the increased fire danger caused by huge areas of dead timber. Furthermore, as populations built, the beetles were able to spread further and faster than normal, affecting both public and private timberland in the region. The Panhandle National Forests initiated emergency salvage logging operations in the region, both to reduce fire risk and to reduce the risk of beetles spreading to adjacent private lands.  Recent findings in forest health research have indicated that the bedrock geology underlying forest stands may play an important role in forest nutrition, and consequently may affect tree susceptibility to insects and disease. While direct relationships between rocks and forest stand health have not yet been established, we believe that such relationships exist. In the current study, Forest Service workers in north Idaho and northeastern Washington noted a tendency for Douglas-fir beetle outbreaks to occur more frequently on certain rock types than others, even though adjacent stands on other rock types seemed otherwise very similar. This analysis utilizes Forest Service data on forest vegetative cover and Douglas-fir beetle distribution in combination with geologic data to assess whether beetles favored stands on certain rock types.","Garrison-Johnston, M.T.; Moore, J.A.; Niehoff, G.",2001-04-01,,research; fire prevention; forest management; timber (lumber); wood borers (beetles); geological maps;,research; fire prevention; forest management; timber (lumber); wood borers (beetles); geological maps;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Geology - Nutrition and Productivity,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Garrison-Johnston, M.T., J.A.

The Effect of Multinutrient Fertilization on Understory Vegetation Annual Production,"This study quantified the effects of operational multinutrient fertilization on understory shrub, forb, and grass production in inland Northwest forests. Understory vegetation annual production increased at some sites while other sites showed no change or decreases following fertilizer treatments. The greatest understory response to fertilization occurred in low density, shade-intolerant, overstory-dominated stands. Understory vegetation response was lower under overstories dominated by more shade-tolerant conifers. Multinutrient fertilization produced increases in annual understory production of up to 2,400 lb/ac for combined understory growth forms over the entire growing season.","VanderSchaaf, C.L.; Moore, J.A.; Kingery, J.L.",2002,,research; shrubs; grasses (plants); fertilizer; statistics;,research; shrubs; grasses (plants); fertilizer; statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Vegetation Management - Nutrition and Productivity,Western Journal of Applied Forestry,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"VanderSchaaf C.L., J.A.

Three-Year Response of Ponderosa Pine Seedlings to Controlled-Release Fertilizer Applied at Planting,"Four controlled-release fertilizers (fast release [FR], moderate release [MR], slow release [SR] and slow release with micronutrients extended [ME]) were applied, at rates of 0, 5, 15 and 30 g/seedling, to ponderosa pine seedlings (Pinus ponderosa Doug. ex Laws) immediately after planting. Compared to the controls, the 5 and15 g/seedling of FR or ME fertilizer produced significantly greater caliper growth and the 5 and 15 g/seedling of ME fertilizer and 15 and 30 g of FR fertilizer produced significantly greater height growth after 3 yr. Mortality occurred mainly during the first growing season and varied substantially with fertilizer types and dosage. High dosage (30 g/seedling) generally caused more mortality than other dosage levels. Seventy-eight, 54, 51, and 36% of total nutrients had been released from the FR, MR, SR and ME products, respectively, by late August of the first growing season. Early in the second growing season, the FR product had released 98% of its total nutrients, and the MR, SR, and ME products had released over 90% of their nutrients. The best fertilizer treatment, 15 g of the ME product, produced a 21% diameter increase and a 30% height increase 3 yr after treatment. The relative magnitude of the growth responses is similar to those observed from other adjacent placement, controlled-release, seedling fertilization studies in the Northwest.","Fan, Z.; Moore, J.A.; Shafii, B.; Osborne, H.L.",2002,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Seedling Growth and Nutrition,Western Journal of Applied Forestry,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Fan, Z., J.A.

Effect of Root-Plug Incorporated Controlled-Release Fertilizer on Two-Year Growth and Survival of Planted Ponderosa Pine Seedlings,"Three controlled-release fertilizers (fast release [FR], moderate release [MR], and slow release [SR]) were incorporated in the root plug at rates of 0.8, 1.6, or 3.2 g/seedling at the time of sowing as supplements to nursery supplied soluble fertilizer. Effects on seedling growth, survival, and foliar nutrient status of the 160/90 container ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) were evaluated after outplanting. At the end of the second growing season, fertilized seedlings had significantly greater diameter and height than unfertilized seedlings. The 3.2 g of MR or SR fertilizer treatments produced significantly higher mortality (55 and 36%, respectively) than the controls. The fast release fertilizer included at a rate of 0.8 g in each seedling's container was the preferred treatment since it produced good survival and seedling growth response. A 2-yr growth response of about 25% was similar to that observed in a nearby study using adjacent placement of controlled-release fertilizer after planting ponderosa pine seedlings.","Moore, J.A.; Fan, Z.; Shafii, B.",2002,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Seedling Growth and Nutrition,Western Journal of Applied Forestry,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Moore, J.A., Z.

Four-Year Foliar and Growth Response to Multinutrient Fertilization in Northeast Oregon,"Results from this study show foliar nutrient deficiencies and multi-nutrient fertilization response for ponderosa pine, grand fir and Douglas-fir over a period of four consecutive growing seasons. Generally, through critical level or vector foliar diagnosis, N, S, B, Cu and possibly Mo were identified as being deficient for all species in this study. Additionally, Douglas-fir on the Noregaard site showed foliar K deficiency response. Distinct foliar nutrient response patterns were observed for those strong responding nutrients, particularly N and B where foliar response increased, peaked then declined in magnitude relative to the control as the year since fertilization increased. Delayed nutrient response may have been to spring fertilizer application not having manifested itself in time to show strong nutrient response one growing season after fertilization.  Similar to foliar nutrient response, foliar needle weight growth increased, peaked then declined in magnitude relative to the control as the year since fertilization increased. Additionally, needle weight response was delayed due to spring fertilization. Needle weight response was significant for ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir but not for grand fir.  Overall, four-year cubic foot volume response was significantly higher on the multi-nutrient treatment than the controls, with relative gross cubic foot volume response for both sites combined showing a 26.9% increase. Individual site response revealed that much of the combined relative cubic foot volume response was expressed on the Clear Creek site, which showed a 34% increase over the controls while the Noregaard site only showed a 3.9% increase. Periodic relative gross basal area response for both sites combined was greater in the first two-year period (26.9%) than the second two-year period (11.1%). Periodic relative basal area response for the Clear Creek unit was 32% the first two-year period and 23% the second two-year period while the Noregaard site response was 18.6% the first period and 6.5% the second.","Shaw, T.M.; Moore, J.A.",2000-03-01,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Shaw, T.M. and J.A.

Two-Year Basal Area Response to Multi-Nutrient Re-fertilization for Douglas-fir in South-Central Washington (Klickitat),"Six fertilization study sites located in the Klickitat region of south-central Washington were established and fertilized in 1990 and then re-fertilized in 1998. Six-year plot response by treatment from the initial fertilization was analyzed and presented in 1997. Two-year re-fertilization plot response by treatment is presented here in short summary form with a final report to follow after further analysis. A brief introduction with site characteristics (Table1), treatments (Table 2) plot response by treatment tables (Tables 3-6) and vector analysis interpretation and diagnosis (Figures 1) follow this summary.  Two-years after re-fertilization the average gross basal area response overall sites combined was - 3.7%, -3.7% and 0.1% for N, N+S and N+S+Micro applications, respectively (Table 3). In comparison, overall six-year volume response reported by Garrison (1997) was positive but was also poor with 10.3% and 8.4% response on the N and N+K applications, respectively (Table 4). Comparison of geologic parent materials underlying the sites showed that four installations occur on Wanapum basalt, one on Grande Ronde basalt and one on landslide olivine basalt. The Wanapum basalt and olivine basalt responded poorly but the single installation which occurred on a Grande Ronde basalt responded very well, with 30.7%, 36.0% and a significant (p &lt; 0.10) 61.3% for N, N+S and N+S+Micro applications, respectively (Table 5). Similarly, six-year volume response also showed this pattern with sites on Wanapum and olivine basalt  responding poorly (data not shown, Garrison et al, 1997) while Grande Ronde basalt response was good with 35.7% and 30% for the N and N+K applications (Table 6). It appears that all the significant (p &lt; 0.10) positive re-fertilization effect was due to the growth response of the Grande Ronde basalt. Notably, the addition of micro nutrients in the 1998 re-fertilization increased response over the N+S treatment by 25.3%. Notably, other IFTNC sites located on Grande Ronde and Wanapum parent materials show similar response trends. Grande Ronde sites almost always respond well to fertilization while Wanapum sites almost always respond poorly to fertilization.  Vector analysis of foliar response (Shaw and Moore, 1999) also diagnosed Grande Ronde basalt as the best responder to fertilization (Figure 1). Furthermore, vector analysis diagnosed good foliar response for Wanapum and olivine basalts, however, this good foliar response did not translate into good two-year basal area growth response for these two rock types. Perhaps nutrients other than those that were applied in the fertilizer mix were deficient and in-turn reduced response on the Wanapum and olivine basalts. For example, vector analysis identified possible Ca deficiencies for olivine basalt and P deficiencies for Wanapum basalt (Figure 1). Further testing needs to be done to determine the validity of Ca and P deficiencies or other possible growth reducing site factors.  Many site induced confounding factors have complicated the results given in this report. In response, additional analysis is now being performed and will be presented in a final report.","Shaw, T.M.; Moore, J.A.",2000-03-01,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Shaw, T.M. and J.A.

Geologic Controls on Tree Nutrition and Forest Health in the Inland Northwest,"The Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) has been studying forest growth and health throughout the Inland Northwest since the early 1980's. Early fertilization work indicated that while nitrogen (N) was important to tree growth, other elements were important to tree physiological processes and forest health. In particular, potassium (K) appeared to alleviate tree susceptibility to fungal disease and insect attack. To further test this theory, the IFTNC designed an N-and-K fertilization-rate experiment encompassing three vegetation series (an expression of climatic regimes) and four rock types (basalt, granite, glacial deposit, and metasedimentary rock). Of the 36 sites required by the experimental design, only 31 were established because of difficulty in finding suitable, healthy and intact forest stands on metasedimentary rock types. Further examination of the effect of rock on forest growth and health was deemed necessary. With the exception of N and sometimes sulfur, all elements essential for plant growth originate from rock. Rock samples were collected from a variety of IFTNC research sites and analyzed for major and selected trace elements. While this allowed for quantitative comparison of individual elements such as K, an assessment of overall elemental availability to plants via rock weathering was also desired. A modification of Reiche's (1943) weathering potential index (WPI) was selected to evaluate rock contribution to plant-available nutrient pools. Comparison of WPI calculations across 30 IFTNC research sites showed that while basalts and granites had fairly narrow WPI ranges, metasedimentary rocks varied widely. Most of the metasedimentary rocks underlying Inland Northwest forests belong to the Belt Supergroup, which encompasses several formations and a wide variety of lithologies. In order to better categorize the geochemical variation of metasedimentary and other rocks, WPI values were calculated for a wide variety of samples collected by Idaho Geological Survey and U.S. Geological Survey personnel throughout northern Idaho. The WPI values were tabulated by lithology and formation and analyzed for differences that might help explain variation in forest nutritional status.","Garrison-Johnston, M.T.; Lewis, R.S.; Frost, T.P.",2003-11-01,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Geology - Nutrition and Productivity,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Garrison-Johnston, M.T., R.S.

Growth and Nutrition of Container-Grown Ponderosa Pine Seedlings with Controlled-Release Fertilizer Incorporated in the Root Plug,"Prior to sowing seeds, three controlled-release fertilizers (fast release (FR), moderate release (MR) and slow release (SR)) were incorporated into the growing media at rates of 0.8, 1.6 or 3.2 g as supplements to nursery supplied soluble fertilizer to grow containerized ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Doug. ex Laws) seedlings in the greenhouse. At lifting, the stem diameter, height and total mass of fertilized seedlings ranged from 14 to 29%, 15 to 22%, and 39 to 100% larger than those of the unfertilized seedlings, respectively. FR provided more balanced nutrients than did MR or SR. The root growth potentials of ponderosa pine treated with 3.2 g of MR or SR were much lower than those of other treatments, indicating that a 3.2 g rate of MR or SR was too high for the seedlings. The estimated best dosages for maximum caliper and height growth were 0.8, 2.2 and 2.0 g for FR, MR and SR fertilizers, respectively.","Fan, Z.; Moore, J.A.; Wenny, D.L.",2003-04-22,,research; roots (plant components); fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; roots (plant components); fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Seedling Growth and Nutrition,Annals of Forest Science,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Fan, Z., J.A.

"Bedrock Type Significantly Affects Individual Tree Mortality for Various Conifers in the Inland Northwest, U.S.A.","Individual tree mortality models for western white pine (Pinus monticola Dougl. ex D. Don), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), grand fir (Abies grandis (Dougl. ex D. Don) Lindl.), western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex. D. Don), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), and western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) were developed using data from permanent research plots located throughout the inland Northwest. The proposed linear logistic models included the following independent variables: diameter at breast height, basal area in larger trees, basal area per hectare, individual tree diameter increment, and a set of dummy variables for the six bedrock types, which were granite, basalt, metasedimentary, sedimentary, mixed glacial till, and deep deposit. The results show that rock type significantly affects individual tree mortality for western white pine, Douglas-fir, and western redcedar, while grand fir, western hemlock, and western larch were not affected. Western white pine and Douglas-fir growing on metasedimentary rocks exhibited greater mortality probabilities than on other rocks. Mortality probabilities for western hemlock were low across all rock types, including nutrient-poor rocks like metasedimentary types.","Moore, J.A.; Hamilton Jr., D.A.; Xiao, Y.; Byrne, J.",2004,,research; data modeling; timber (lumber);,research; data modeling; timber (lumber);,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Geology - Nutrition and Productivity,Canadian Journal of Forest Research,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Moore J.A., D.A.

Franco) to decreased susceptibility to Armillaria spp. While these studies have identified environmental factors that influence root chemistry, none have examined whether the phenolics/sugar ratio is genetically controlled. In this study, we investigated the effects of genetics and environment on the root bark chemistry of 20 families of 15-year-old Douglas-fir planted in two sites in northern Idaho. Only sugar concentrations varied significantly among families, but site was a significant source of variation for phenolics and the phenolics/sugar ratio.  Family site interactions were significant for the concentrations of all measured root bark compounds as well as for the phenolics/sugar ratio. Phenotypic correlations between height and the phenolics/sugar ratio and between height and sugar concentrations were not significant. However, families with superior height growth and below-average sugar concentrations could be found at both sites. Should a high phenolics/sugar ratio prove effective in selecting genotypes for resistance to Armillaria infection, these results suggest that gains could be made more efficiently by selecting for low sugar concentrations.","Myszewski, J.H.; Fins, L.; Moore, J.A.; Rust, M.; Mika, P.G.",2002-03-14,,research; roots (plant components); sugar; statistics;,research; roots (plant components); sugar; statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Health and Nutrition,Canadian Journal of Forest Research,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Myszewski, J.H., L.

Foliar Nutrient Characteristics of Four Conifer Species in the Interior Northwest United States,"This article provides foliar nutrient concentration distributions and sample size calculations for Douglas-fir, grand fir, ponderosa pine, and lodgepole pine. Managers can obtain foliar nutrient values from their own lands and use this information to make judgments on the relative nutrient status of forest stands. Foliage was collected from unfertilized trees at 160 different research sites of the Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative spanning a 16 yr period from 1982 to 1997. Douglas-fir showed the lowest variation in foliar nutrient concentrations, while grand fir was the most variable of the species sampled. Nitrogen was the least variable and Mn and Mo generally the most variable elements for all species. Grand fir had much higher foliar concentrations of K and Ca than the other species. Ponderosa pine had the highest foliar N concentrations. The pines generally have lower nutrient concentrations than the firs, with the exception of Zn. Western hemlock habitat types showed lower Douglas-fir foliar Ca, Mg, and B concentrations, but higher K concentrations than other habitat type series. Douglas-fir growing on soils derived from meta-sedimentary rocks generally had lower foliar nutrient concentrations than those growing on other rock types.","Moore, J.A.; Mika, P.G.; Shaw, T.M.; Garrison-Johnston, M.I.",2004,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,Western Journal of Applied Forestry,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Moore, J.A., P.G.

Ash Cap Influences on Site Productivity and Fertilizer Response in Forests of the Inland Northwest,"Data from 139 research sites throughout the Inland Northwest were analyzed for effects of ash cap on site productivity, nutrient availability and fertilization response. Stand productivity and nitrogen (N) fertilizer response were greater on sites with ash cap than on sites without. Where ash was present, depth of ash had no effect on site productivity or N fertilizer response. Site productivity increased with increasing potentially available soil water. Potentially available soil water, in turn, increased with increasing ash depth. Decreasing availability of magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) in the upper 12 inches of soil may have constrained site productivity with increasing ash depth. Soil mineralizable N and ammonium N were unaffected by ash presence or depth but did vary by underlying parent material. Site productivity and N fertilizer response varied by underlying parent material even after accounting for ash presence. Stand volume response to sulfur (S) fertilization decreased with increasing ash depth, suggesting possible S adsorption by ash cap. No growth response or change in foliar K status was discerned following K fertilization. Management recommendations by parent material are provided.","Garrison-Johnston, M.T.; Mika, P.G.; Miller, D.L.; Cannon, P.; Johnson, L.R.",2007-01-01,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Soils - Nutrition and Productivity,USDA Forest Service Proceedings,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Garrison-Johnston, Mariann T., Peter G.

Management of Ponderosa Pine Nutrition Through Fertilization,"The results of a series of replicated fertilization trials established throughout the Inland Northwest were reviewed for information specific to ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. and C. Lawson) nutrition. Ponderosa pine nitrogen (N) status was often better than the N-status of other Inland Northwest species, and therefore growth response to N fertilization was often lower than that of other species. Fertilization of ponderosa pine with N alone sometimes appeared to cause increased tree susceptibility to mortality by insect, disease and perhaps abiotic stresses. Growth and mortality response to N fertilization appeared to be related to foliage potassium (K)/N ratio in some cases. The application of K and micronutrients in combination with N may have protected the trees from N-related mortality while stimulating a growth response. Sulfur fertilization was not found to evoke a growth response in ponderosa pine, and may have increased mortality rates slightly. On certain rock types and vegetation series, ponderosa pine showed high growth response to macronutrient plus micronutrient fertilization as well as herbicide treatment. Ponderosa pine generally did not show a strong growth response to N fertilization, except on 'good' rock types on moist sites. Multinutrient (macro- plus micronutrient) fertilization combined with an herbicide treatment often provided a better response than N alone on moderate to dry sites and/or 'bad' rock types. Other species in mixed-conifer stands, particularly grand fir (Abies grandis (Dougl. ex D. Don) Lindl.), often showed a better growth response to fertilization than ponderosa pine. The nutritional ecology of ponderosa pine is unique among Inland forest tree species and should be considered when evaluating nutrient management options.","Garrison-Johnston, M.T.; Shaw, T.M.; Mika, P.G.; Johnson, L.R.",2005-01-01,,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; fertilizer; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Ponderosa Pine Regional Fertilization Trials,USDA Forest Service,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Garrison-Johnston, Mariann, Terry Shaw, Peter Mika and Leonard R.

Fate of Applied Sulfate in Volcanic Ash-Influenced Forest Soils,"Forests in the Inland Northwest, USA, commonly show SO4 defi-ciency, suggesting limited SO4 availability in the soils. Regional soils, which lie between the east slopes of the northern Cascade Range and the west slopes of the northern Rocky Mountains, are influenced to varying degrees by poorly crystalline aluminosilicates and ferrihydrite, and are often classified as Andisols (Andosols). Research has shown that SO4 retention is greatly influenced by Fe and Al oxides. However, little is known of the sorption behavior exhibited by poorly crystalline andic soils of the region. In this study we investigated the mineralogy and SO4 sorption capacity of ash-influenced soils found in the Inland Northwest. Batch SO4 adsorption experiments showed that up to 40% of added SO4 was adsorbed. Furthermore, there were positive correlations between soil SO4 adsorption capacity and increasing ash influence as measured by (i) the andic soil parameter % Alo + 0.5%Feo (R2 = 0.89), (ii) P retention (R2 = 0.91), and (iii) NaF pH (R2 = 0.48). Soil pH, total organic C (TOC), and percentage of clay showed insignificant or inconclusive relationships with SO4 adsorption. Re-lease of adsorbed SO4 was significantly lower in volcanic ash-influenced soils as compared with non-ash soils, indicating a greater affinity for SO4. These results indicate that poorly crystalline aluminosilicates and Fe oxides significantly influence the amount of SO4 present in forest soil solutions. Successful nutrient management plans must rec-ognize the sorption behavior of these andic soils.","Kimsey, Jr., M.; McDaniel, P.; Strawn, D.; Moore, J.",2005-08-04,,research; soil science; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; soil science; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Soils - Nutrition and Productivity,Soil Science Society of America,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Kimsey, M.

Cochran. The incorporation ofthe Cochran method was introduced to NRCS Idaho from NRCS Oregon with Technical Note 190-VI.  Development of yield and site index curves by Cochran was based entirely on forest stands located on the eastslopes ofthe Cascade Range and Blue Mountains ofeastern Oregon/southeast Washington.

This dissimilarity will inherently create significant predicted site index and yield error when using the Cochran method in north Idaho. Furthermore, there were very few Cochran research plots established on cedarlhemlock habitat types. Consequently, volume and site index estimates generated by the Cochran method will not reflect north Idaho productivity on these more climax habitat types.  Several USDA-USFS research projects specifically developed site index and yield curves for north Idaho. Research papers INT-347 (R.A. Monserud, 1985) and INT-394 (A.

Nitrogen Uptake and Turnover in Riparian Woody Vegetation: A 15N Tracer Experiment,"The nutrient balance of streams and adjacent riparian ecosystems may have been modified by the elimination of anadromous fish runs and perhaps by forest fertilization. To better understand nitrogen dynamics within stream and riparian ecosystems, and the nitrogen transfer between them, we fertilized two streams and their adjacent riparian corridors in central Idaho. On each stream two nitrogen doses were applied to a swathe approximately 35 m wide centered on the stream. The fertilizer N was enriched in 15N to 18%. This enrichment is light relative to many previous labeling studies, yet sufficient to yield a traceable signal in riparian and stream biota. This paper reports pre-treatment differences in ?15N and the first-year N response to fertilizer within the riparian woody plant community. Future manuscripts will describe the transfer of allochthonous litter N to the stream and its subsequent processing by stream biota. Pre-treatment ?15N differed between the two creeks (p = 0.00016), possibly due to residual salmon nitrogen on one of the creeks. Pre-treatment ?15N of current-year needles was enriched compared to leaf litter, which was in turn enriched compared to needles aged 4 years and older. This leads us to conclude that fractionation due to retranslocation occurs in two phases. The first, which optimizes allocation of N in younger needle age classes, is distinctly different from the second, which conserves N prior to abscission. The ?15N difference between creeks was eliminated by the fertilization (p = 0.42). In the two dominant conifer species, Abies lasiocarpa and Picea engelmannii, most fertilizer N was found in the current-year foliage; little was found in older needles and none was detected in litter (p = 0.53). In the only N-fixing shrub species, Alnus incana, little fertilizer N was detected (mean percent N derived from fertilizer (%Ndff) 5.0 1.6% (se)). Far more fertilizer N was taken up by other deciduous shrubs (mean %Ndff = 33.9 4.5%).  Fertilizer N made up 25 ( 4.2%) of the N in deciduous shrub litter. These results demonstrate the importance of pre-treatment measurements, the feasibility of light labeling with 15N, and the potential influence of riparian plant species composition on stream nutrient dynamics via allochthonous leaf litter inputs.","Chambers, C.S.",2003-05-01,John D.

Effects of Machine Traffic on the Physical Properties of Ash-Cap Soils,"With pressure and vibration on a soil, air spaces between soil particles can be reduced by displaced soil particles. Activity associated with heavy machine traffic increases the density of the soil and can also increase the resistance of the soil to penetration. This paper reviews research related to disturbance of forest soils with a primary focus on compaction in ash-cap soils. The general process of compaction is described along with physical properties of ash-cap soils that relate to compaction. Ash-cap soils have physical soil properties most closely aligned to silt-loam soils. Undisturbed ash-cap soils often have low bulk densities to variable depths. Under moisture conditions near field capacity, these soils are susceptible to significant disturbance from machine traffic, and when the disturbance causes increases in bulk density, the soils are not likely to recover from this disturbed condition for many years. Machine traffic on forest soils generally occurs as a result of some form of active stand management including precommercial thinning, intermediate and final timber harvest, and site preparation activities involving slash disposal and treatment. The direct contact between equipment and the forest soil will result in some type of soil disturbance. The degree and extent of the soil disturbance is most often controlled through guidelines on the selection and operation of equipment and by restricting the location and operating season for equipment.","Johnson, L.R.; Page-Dumroese, D.; Han, H.",2007-01-01,,research; soil science; forest management;,research; soil science; forest management;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Soils - Nutrition and Productivity,USDA Forest Service Proceedings,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Johnson, Leonard R., Debbie Page-Dumroese and Han-Sup Han. 2007.

Phylogeographic Patterns of Armillaria ostoyae in the Western United States,"Nuclear ribosomal DNA regions (i.e. large subunit, internal transcribed spacer, 5.8S and intergenic spacer) were sequenced using a direct-polymerase chain reaction method from Armillaria ostoyae genets collected from the western USA. Many of the A. ostoyae genets contained heterogeneity among rDNA repeats, indicating intragenomic variation and likely intraspecific hybridization. Intragenomic variation was verified by visually editing base-sequence offsets in regions with insertions/deletions, and using sequence-specific internal primers to resequence heterogeneous regions. Phylogenetic analyses with Bayesian Inference methods were used to define groups within A. ostoyae. Analysis of A. ostoyae from outside the western USA indicated the presence of a Circumboreal group of A. ostoyae that also occurs in Utah; two other phylogeographic groups were associated with the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Northwest regions of the USA. Mixed sequence types, an indication of intraspecific hybrids, were common in some geographic regions. Hybridization events may have influenced species evolution, contributing to variation in pathogenicity and virulence. The occurrence of these groups and intraspecific hybrids also indicates that paleogeography and paleoclimate may have influenced the phylogeography of A. ostoyae. In addition, other Armillaria species were examined for evolutionary relationships with the groups of A. ostoyae. These findings will provide a basis for future research relating ecological function to genetic diversity within A. ostoyae.","Hanna, J.W.; Klopfenstein, N.B.; Kim, M.S.; McDonald, G.I.; Moore, J.A.",2007,,research; genetics; timber (lumber);,research; genetics; timber (lumber);,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",,Forest Pathology,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Hanna, J.

Ecological and Topographic Features of Volcanic Ash-Influenced Forest Soils,Volcanic ash distribution and thickness were determined for a forested region of north-central Idaho. Mean ash thickness and multiple linear regression analyses were used to model the effect of environmental variables on ash thickness. Slope and slope curvature relationships with volcanic ash thickness varied on a local spatial scale across the study area. Ash distribution and aspect showed weak correlation. Elevation and ecologically based plant associations accounted for about 54 percent of the observed variation in volcanic ash thickness. Climax plant associations moister than grand fir/queen cup beadlily (Abies grandis/Clintonia uniflora) had consistently thick ash mantles and soils that would be classified as either Andisols or andic subgroups using Soil Taxonomy. The statistical model error of 10.7 cm was significantly lower than the &gt;20 cm variation often found in local soil series. This model quantitatively assesses ash distribution and can be integrated into other local ecological models.,"Kimsey, M.; Gardner, B.; Busacca, A.",2007,,research; soil science; data modeling; statistics;,research; soil science; data modeling; statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Soils - Nutrition and Productivity,USDA Forest Service Proceedings,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Kimsey, M.J., and B.

Can Portable Pyrolysis Units Make Biomass Utilization Affordable While Using Bio-Char to Enhance Soil Productivity and Sequester Carbon?,"We describe a portable pyrolysis system for bioenergy production from forest biomass that minimizes long-distance transport costs and provides for nutrient return and long-term soil carbon storage. The cost for transporting biomass to conversion facilities is a major impediment to utilizing forest biomass. If forest biomass could be converted into bio-oil in the field, it may be more profitable to utilize forest biomass for bioenergy. Bio-oil can substitute for fuel oil, or be used as a crude oil and further refined into additional products. Transporting energy-dense bio-oil is more cost effective than transporting bulky, low-value biomass. In-woods pyrolysis can also address concerns over removing nutrients and carbon from forest sites through reapplication of bio-char, a pyrolysis byproduct, which is equivalent to the charcoal found in all fire ecosystems. Bio-char is 70-80 percent carbon and retains most nutrients contained in biomass. It can be used as a soil amendment to enhance soil productivity through a liming effect, which improves cation exchange capacity and base saturation, increasing anion availability, improving water holding capacity and decreasing bulk density. Charcoal is known to remain stable in soils for hundreds to thousands of years. Long charcoal residence times provide a way to quickly sequester atmospheric carbon by assimilating it into a recalcitrant form that can be applied to soils. In total the portable pyrolysis approach has the potential to improve the economic efficiency of biomass removal from overstocked forests through the in-woods conversion of biomass to bio-oil that avoids the costs and emissions of transportation to central facilities. Biochar can be returned to the forest economically if pyrolysis occurs at or near the site of biomass removal. Reapplication of bio-char will sequester carbon in soil and may enhance site productivity.","Coleman, M.; Page-Dumroese, D.; Archuleta, J.; Badger, P.; Chung, W.; Venn, T.; Loeffler, D.; Jones, G.; McElligott, K.",2010,,research; pyrolysis;,research; pyrolysis;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA","Forest Biomass Removal, Utilization (Bio-energy) and Soil Enhancement (Biochar)",USDA Forest Service Proceedings,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,Can Portable Pyrolysis Units Make Biomass Utilization Affordable While Using Bio-Char to Enhance Soil Productivity and Sequester Carbon?

"Bioenergy Production Systems and Biochar Application in Forests: Potential for Renewable Energy, Soil Enhancement, and Carbon Sequestration","Bioenergy production from forest biomass offers a unique solution to reduce wildfire hazard fuel while producing a useful source of renewable energy. However, biomass removals raise concerns about reducing soil carbon and altering forest site productivity. Biochar additions have been suggested as a way to mitigate soil carbon loss and cycle nutrients back into forestry sites; yet, little is known about the effects of intentional biochar amendments to temperate forest soil in conjunction with biomass removals for bioenergy production. In this review, we evaluate the potential for mobile bioenergy systems and the environmental implications of biochar application in forests. Using forest biomass that accumulates annually during forest harvest operations, bioenergy can be produced on-site and the biochar that is generated can be redistributed to return nutrients and help improve water holding capacity of the site. Little is known about the short- and long-term impacts of biochar application in forest ecosystems. Some sites may benefit from biochar application, while others show no or negative responses. Field studies on soil and vegetation responses combined with laboratory studies will elucidate the best sites for biochar application and sustainable bioenergy production.","McElligott, K.M.; Page-Dumroese, D.; Coleman, M.",2011-10-01,,research; fire prevention; forest management; timber (lumber);,research; fire prevention; forest management; timber (lumber);,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA","Forest Biomass Removal, Utilization (Bio-energy) and Soil Enhancement (Biochar)",United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Bioenergy Productions Systems and Biochar Application in Forests: Potential for Renewable Energy, Soil Enhancement, and Carbon Sequestration.

Comparing Regional and Site-Specific Biomass and Nutrient Budget Models for Douglas-fir,"Biomass estimation models are often used to aid in developing site nutrient budgets. However, readily available biomass models are regional and thus potentially mask nutritional affects of site-type. Site nutrient richness may influence Douglas-fir allometric relationships and could affect the nutrient content of tree components. To test this, we selected mature stands of consistent climate regime that were deemed either poor site nutrition (quartzite parent material, 3 sites) or good site nutrition (basalt parent material, 3 sites). This comparison will help define when and where generalized or site-specific biomass models.","Robertson, A.; Coleman, M.; Davis, A.; Black, A.",2011-06-23,,research; data modeling; timber (lumber); statistics;,research; data modeling; timber (lumber); statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA","Forest Biomass Removal, Utilization (Bio-energy) and Soil Enhancement (Biochar)","Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow; Washington State University, School of Biological Sciences, Pullman",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Robertson, et al. 2011.

Site Preparation Effects on Volcanic Ash Forest Soils and Douglas-fir Regeneration,"Physical and chemical soil characteristics along with Douglas-fir (Psuedotsuga menziesii var. glauca) growth and foliar nutrition were tracked over a 24 yr period following a ground based regeneration harvest and site preparation in northern Idaho, USA. Harvest unit soils were classified as Andisols overlaying metasedimentary parent material within an udic-frigid moisture and temperature regime. Douglas-fir site index at base age 50 was 29 m. Four site preparation conditions were monitored: undisturbed control, broadcast burn, pile and burn, and mechanical scarification. Periodic soil-site measurements were collected on each condition at regeneration stand ages 6, 14 and 24 yrs. Six and 14-yr soil bulk density on scarified conditions were significantly higher at 0-15 and 15-30 cm than all other conditions. Scarified soil bulk density showed recovery to non-scarify condition levels at 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm after 24 yrs. Scarified soil organic matter (SOM) and N were significantly reduced by 32 and 42% over control levels 6 yrs post-harvest. After 24 yrs, scarified SOM and N were significantly lower than that found in broadcast burn (44 and 54%) and pile and burn (33% and 49%). Douglas-fir needle mass and foliar N and P content on scarified conditions were significantly lower than broadcast burn or pile and burn conditions after 24 yrs (p&lt;0.1). Soil and foliar N content was significantly higher in those conditions receiving a burn application after 24 yrs (p&lt;0.1). Tree growth on either burn condition showed significantly greater diameter (35%), height (14%) and volume (92%) when compared to trees growing on scarified conditions after 24 yrs (p&lt;0.1). These results indicate that tree growth on frigid, ash-mantled forest soils of the Inland Northwest can be significantly reduced following soil compaction and displacement of organic-rich topsoil. Where soil disturbance is minimized and organic matter retention is coupled with a burn treatment, soil and tree productivity will be maintained or enhanced.","Kimsey, M.; Roche, D.",2012,,research; soil science; statistics;,research; soil science; statistics;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA","Forest Biomass Removal, Utilization (Bio-energy) and Soil Enhancement (Biochar)","Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Kimsey, M., D.

Douglas-Fir Beetle Infestations Are Associated with Certain Rock and Stand Types in the Inland Northwestern United States,"Landscape-level geographic analysis was used to examine the occurrence of Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) in association with geology (rock type) and forest stand types on the Panhandle National Forests of northern Idaho and northeastern Washington from 1996 to 1999. Beetle infestations occurred most often in mature stands comprised primarily of trees 23 cm in diameter at breast height ( 1.4 m), in habitat types likely to contain Douglas-fir. Douglas-fir stands growing on Prichard and lower Wallace formation metasedimentary rocks and intrusive dikes and sills were signicantly more likely than Douglas-firr stands growing on other rock types to harbor beetle populations during nonoutbreak years early in the study period. By 1999 (when outbreak populations of Douglas-fir beetle were present), beetle infestations occurred across all rock types at rates proportional to the amount ofstand area on those rocks, indicating a decrease in infestation rates for stands on particular rock types when beetle populations were large. Although the biological mechanisms influencing beetle preferences were not examined, information derived in this study could be useful in developing quantitative hazard-rating models for Douglas-fir beetle, and, subsequently, in designing silvicultural practices to reduce the amount of beetle-susceptible Douglas-fir stands on particular rock types.","Garrison-Johnston, M.T.; Moore, J.A.; Cook, S.P.; Niehoff, G.J.",2003-08-12,,research; forest management; timber (lumber); wood borers (beetles);,research; forest management; timber (lumber); wood borers (beetles);,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Geology - Nutrition and Productivity,Environmental Entomology,Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Garrison-Johnston, M.T., J.A.

Development of Nutrient Status in Forest Soils,"Most of the elements which are considered essential for plant growth come from the soil. The inland northwest region is very young geologically, and therefore rock type strongly influences soil characteristics and forest nutrient status. A number of significant geologic events in the history of the inland northwest result in the predominance of a few common rock types in the area, including basalts, granites, metasedimentary rocks and glacial deposits. Average geochemistry of rocks collected from Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) research sites show that basalts contain the greatest percent by weight of elements which are considered mineral nutrients, followed by granites and then metasedimentary rocks. Mineralogical analyses of the same rocks show that basalts contain the most weatherable minerals, followed by granites and then metasedimentary rocks. These findings are supported by a geochemical-based weathering potential index calculated for each rock type. Glacial deposits typically reflect a wide variety of characteristics due to the variety of rock types comprising such deposits. Climate, biota, time and topography also interact with geology to influence soil formation in the inland northwest.","Garrison-Johnston, M.T.",2002-09-09,,research; soil science;,research; soil science;,,North and Central Idaho; Eastern Washington; Western Montana; Northeastern Oregon,"Intermountain West, USA",Forest Soils - Nutrition and Productivity,"Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative, University of Idaho, College of Forest, Wildlife and Range Sciences, Moscow",Intermountain Forest Tree Nutrition Cooperative (IFTNC) Collection,University of Idaho,"Garrison-Johnston, M.T., 2003.

Two-Year Growth Response of Douglas-fir and Ponderosa Pine Seedlings to Boron and Multi-Nutrient Fertilization in Northeast Oregon,"The two-year growth effects for Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine seedlings receiving boron and/or multi-nutrient fertilizer treatments were evaluated on sites with two contrasting parent materials, basalt and andesite, in northeast Oregon. In general, the overall growth effect of fertilization was low and varied by treatment, species and site. In most cases, when boron was applied alone, response was low or antagonistic for both species. Boron in combination with other nutrients did not consistently show higher responses over treatments without B in the mix. However, ponderosa pine at the Noregaard site did show higher response when B was in the fertilizer treatment. Significant (p &lt; 0.10) two-year response was shown for ponderosa pine at Noregaard with 22% and 36% increase in volume growth for the N+B and multi-nutrient with B treatments, respectively. Overall, trees did have better growth response to fertilization at the Noregaard (good rock) basalt site than at the Glass Hill (bad rock) andesite site. The varied and unusually low growth response may be attributed to confounding effects caused by repeated fertilization treatments over the duration of this study.",Terry M. Shaw; Leonard R.
