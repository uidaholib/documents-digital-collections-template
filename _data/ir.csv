ir0000,Colliding scopes:seeing academic library leadership through a lens of complexity,Lynn Baird,2010,Academic libraries routinely negotiate layers of change as embedded organizations in higher education institutions. Facing competing demands with limited resources gave rise to the question: how do academic library deans effectively lead their organizations in times of change? A Delphi Method study was conducted to identify successful leadership actions of academic library deans. Two panels of experts from land grant universities where librarians have faculty status and participate in the tenure process were convened: one of library deans and the other of academic deans. The data generated was analyzed through three lenses: a discussion of context for the study; an exploration of organizational climates as suggested by differences between academic colleges and libraries; and an examination of successful leadership actions and decisions within a model of complexity leadership. The resultant meta-analysis of complexity leadership theory provides insights about organizations and human resource development needed for adaptation and survival in the context of ceaseless change. ,"Dissertation (PhD, Education), University of Idaho, September 2010.

ir0001,Investigation of RNA Hairpin Loop Folding with Time-Resolved Infrared Spectroscopy,"Stancik, Aaron Lee",2012-01-01,"Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) are a group of functional biopolymers central to the molecular underpinnings of life. To complete the many processes they mediate, RNAs must fold into precise three?dimensional structures. Hairpin loops are the most ubiquitous and basic structural elements present in all folded RNAs, and are the foundation upon which all complex tertiary structures are built. A hairpin loop forms when a single stranded RNA molecule folds back on itself creating a helical stem of paired bases capped by a loop. This work investigates the formation of UNCG hairpin loops with the sequence 5’?GC(UNCG)GC?3’ (N = A, U, G, or C) using both equilibrium infrared (IR) and time?resolved IR spectroscopy. Equilibrium IR melting data were used to determine thermodynamic parameters. Melting temperatures ranged from 50 to 60°C, and enthalpies of unfolding were on the order of 100 kJ/mol. In the time?resolved work, temperature jumps of up to 20°C at 2.5°C increments were obtained with transient relaxation kinetics spanning nanoseconds to hundreds of microseconds. The relaxation kinetics for all of the oligomers studied were fit to first or second order exponentials. Multiple vibrational transitions were probed on each oligomer for fully folded and partially denatured structures. In the time?resolved limit, in contrast to equilibrium melting, RNA does not fold according to two?state behavior. These results are some of the first to show that RNA hairpins fold according to a rugged energy landscape, which contradicts their relatively simple nature. In addition, this work has proven that time?resolved IR spectroscopy is a powerful and novel tool for investigating the earliest events of RNA folding, the formation of the  hairpin loop.","Dissertation (PhD, Chemistry), University of Idaho, January 2012.

ir0005,"Ranch-Level Economic Impact Analysis for Public Lands: A Guide to Methods, Issues, and Applications",L. Allen Torell; Neil R. Rimbey; John A. Tanaka; David T. Taylor; J. D. Wulfhorst,2014,"Legal mandates require public land managers to consider social and economic impacts in planning efforts, and analysts seek models and tools for use in resource planning and impact assessment. In this paper we review state-of-the-art methods and models that can be used to evaluate ranch-level decisions and land-use policy impacts. Most ranch models use profit-maximization as the decision criterion, but it must be recognized that ranchers make decisions with personal objectives that are broader than just profit. Investments in rangeland improvement practices or management changes can be assessed using standard investment analysis (e.g., net present value, benefit/cost, or internal rate of return). Ranching is a year-round endeavor and changes in a specific season of grazing use or management activity may have greater impact on the whole ranch operation than can be accounted for by analyzing seasons or levels of grazing use in isolation. Impacts will vary with available forage alternatives, ranch resources, and management options. Current models use recursive linear programming or simulations to assess impacts over multiple years. Ranching and grazing on rangelands can affect the production of a variety of ecosystem services, though these are often not quantified or included in either investment analysis or economic models that describe ranch businesses. Because no formal markets exist for many ecosystem services, establishing a value has proven difficult. The few studies that have attempted to quantify ecosystem service values report said values without strong justification for the defined level of goods and services expected under alternative actions and policies.","An article from the Journal of Rangeland Applications, an open access journal published at the University of Idaho.",benefit/cost analysis; economic impacts; ecosystem services; ranch budgets,,,,,"Journal of Rangeland Applications, Vol 1 (2014), 1-13",text,Text,application/pdf,en,http://journals.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/jra/article/view/13/54,"In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted.

ir0006,Implications of Longer Term Grazing Rest in the Sagebrush Steppe,Kirk W. Davies; Martin Vavra; Brad W. Schultz; Neil R. Rimbey,2014,"Longer term grazing rest has occurred or been proposed in large portions of the sagebrush steppe based on the assumption that it will improve ecosystem properties. However, information regarding the influence of longer term rest from grazing is limited and has not been summarized. We synthesized the scientific literature on long-term rest in the sagebrush steppe to evaluate the potential ecosystem effects and identify factors that influence those effects. Longer term rest is clearly advantageous compared to detrimental grazing practices (i.e., repeated defoliation during the growing season without periodic deferment or short-term rest). Changing grazing management from detrimental use to modern recommended grazing practices or dormant season use will likely convey the same benefits as long-term grazing rest in most situations. In general, long-term rest and modern properly managed grazing produce few significant differences. However, some topic areas have not been adequately studied to accurately predict the influence of long-term rest compared to managed grazing. In some situations, long-term rest may cause negative ecological effects. Not grazing can cause an accumulation of fine fuels that increase fire risk and severity and, subsequently, the probability of sagebrush steppe rangelands converting to exotic annual grasslands. One common theme we found was that shifts in plant communities (i.e., exotic annual grass invasion and western juniper encroachment), caused in part from historical improper grazing, cannot be reversed by long-term rest. This synthesis suggests that land managers should carefully consider if long-term rest will actually achieve their management goals and if a change in grazing management would achieve similar results","An article from the Journal of Rangeland Applications, an open access journal published at the University of Idaho.",dormant season grazing; exclosures; grazing interactions; herbivory; proper management,,,,,"Journal of Rangeland Applications, Vol 1 (2014), 14-34",text,Text,application/pdf,en,http://journals.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/jra/article/view/15/58,"In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted.

Allen Torell,2014,"Herbivory and fire are natural interacting forces contributing to the maintenance of rangeland ecosystems. Wildfires in the sagebrush dominated ecosystems of the Great Basin are becoming larger and more frequent, and may dramatically alter plant communities and habitat. This synthesis describes what is currently known about the cumulative impacts of historic livestock grazing patterns and short-term effects of livestock grazing on fuels and fire in sagebrush ecosystems. Over years and decades grazing can alter fuel characteristics of ecosystems. On a yearly basis, grazing can reduce the amount and alter the continuity of fine fuels, potentially changing wildlife fire spread and intensity. However, how grazing-induced fuel alterations affect wildland fire depends on weather conditions and plant community characteristics. As weather conditions become extreme, the influence of grazing on fire behavior is limited, especially in communities dominated by woody plants.","An article from the Journal of Rangeland Applications, an open access journal published at the University of Idaho.",annual grasses; wildlife fire; prescribed grazing; sagebrush; fuel treatments,,,,,"Journal of Rangeland Applications, Vol 1 (2014), 35-57",text,Text,application/pdf,en,http://journals.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/jra/article/view/12/59,"In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted.

ir0008,Livestock Grazing and Sage-Grouse Habitat: Impacts and Opportunities,Chad S. Boyd; Jeffrey L. Beck; John A. Tanaka,2014,"Sage-grouse obtain resources for breeding, summer, and winter life stages from sagebrush communities. Grazing can change the productivity, composition, and structure of herbaceous plants in sagebrush communities, thus directly influencing the productivity of nesting and early brood-rearing habitats. Indirect influences of livestock grazing and ranching on sage-grouse habitat include fencing, watering facilities, treatments to increase livestock forage, and targeted grazing to reduce fine fuels. To illustrate the relative value of sagebrush habitats to sage-grouse on year-round and seasonal bases, we developed state and transition models to conceptualize the interactions between wildfire and grazing in mountain and Wyoming big sagebrush communities. In some sage-grouse habitats, targeted livestock grazing may be useful for reducing fine fuels produced by annual grasses. We provide economic scenarios for ranches that delay spring turnout on public lands to increase herbaceous cover for nesting sage-grouse. Proper rangeland management is critical to reduce potential negative effects of livestock grazing to sage-grouse habitats.","An article from the Journal of Rangeland Applications, an open access journal published at the University of Idaho.",Centrocercus urophasianus; livestock grazing; mountain big sagebrush; Wyoming big sagebrush; sage-grouse; economics,,,,,"Journal of Rangeland Applications, Vol 1 (2014), 58-77",text,Text,application/pdf,en,http://journals.lib.uidaho.edu/index.php/jra/article/view/17/57,"In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted.

ir0009,"Population Dynamics, Habitat Use and Movements of Greater Sage-Grouse in Moffat County, Colorado","Hausleitner, Doris",2003,"Long-term declines in greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) abundance may be associated with low productivity due to habitat degradation. Therefore, I investigated the effects of vegetation characteristics on nest site selection and success, and created predictive models using forward stepwise logistic regression. Greater sage-grouse nested in sites having greater sagebrush canopy cover, nest shrub height and visual obstruction than random sites. Forb cover was greater at nest sites than random but grass cover and % exotic species at the nest bowl were greater at random sites than nest sites.  Nest success was high with 58% (n = I08) of hens hatching 2: 1 egg. Nest success was positively associated with plant species richness, percent sagebrush, grass and forb cover and negatively associated with exotic herbaceous cover. Additionally, grass heights measured at the nest bowl and at I m from the nest bowl were parameters associated with nest success. Vegetation was reduced in 2002, a year with less spring precipitation, and may be associated with lower nest success. Habitat management to encourage greater sage-grouse nest success should promote native herbaceous understory growth in April and May and discourage sagebrush removal.  Habitat management guidelines are based, in part, on studies of greater sage-grouse nest site selection, which measure habitat characteristics post-hatch,&gt; 30 days after initiation. Thus, these recommendations may be flawed due to the time lag in sampling. I investigated differences in habitat at initiation versus hatch using previous year's nest sites. A randomized complete block MANOV A indicated differences based on timing of sampling. The difference was largely due to grass height and percent grass cover. Grass heights at the nest bowl and at 1 m were 10 cm and 9 cm at initiation and I6 cm and I3 cm at hatch, respectively. Percent grass cover of the sample plot increased from 4 to 6% cover from initiation to hatch. Sampling techniques conducted at hatch sufficiently describes nest site habitat at selection apart from grass heights and grass cover.   Despite extensive research into the habitat requirements of greater sage-grouse, summer night-roosting habitat has received no attention. Therefore, I investigated the vegetation characteristics of brood and night roost selection arid compared diurnal and nocturnal habitat use and selection. Predictive models were created using forward stepwise logistic regression. Greater sage-grouse selected brood-use areas with greater visual obstruction, greater forb cover and less bare ground than random.  Night-roost locations were characterized by less bare ground and visual obstruction but greater percent forb cover than at random sites. Mean shrub cover and shrub height at night roost locations was lower (9% vs. 22%) and shorter (31 vs. 58 cm) than at brood sites. Forb cover was an important predictor of both diurnal and nocturnal habitat use but did not meet the minimum requirements of 2: 1 Oo/o suggested by management guidelines. Current habitat management guidelines attend only to diurnal habitat needs and should be revised in order to address the variance in temporal habitat selection. I described home range, daily movements and survival of greater sage-grouse monthly, seasonally and annually. Median daily movement during the brood-rearing period was greater for females with broods (184m/day) than those without broods (103m/day), and was not associated with chicks/female at 6 weeks post-hatch. Lek to nest distance and brood home range sizes were greater for females that nested in the Axial Basin (4.6 km, 1,151 ha) than the Danforth Hills (2.6 km, 439 ha) indicating that habitat conditions may be causing greater movement in the Axial Basin. Distances moved from the last diurnal location to night roost sites (397m) suggested that females with broods were required to move 2 times their median daily movement in order to find suitable night-roost habitat and that seasonal movement estimates in the literature may be biased low. Annual home range sizes of yearlings and adults, and seasonal movements from the lek of capture indicated that the population of greater sage-grouse in the Axial Basin and Danforth Hills was non-migratory. Annual survival rates were greater for yearling (7 5%) than adult females (57%). Year, seasonal trend and age were variables that contributed to predictive annual survival models.   Survival rates were lowest in the breeding and brood-rearing periods and increased through the fall and winter. Body condition indices, serum chemical constituents and disease prevalence were estimated for pre-laying female greater sage-grouse. Previous studies conjectured prematernal diet was associated with greater•sage-grouse productivity and survival but gave no specifics on condition with respect to body size or serum biochemical constituents. Thus I investigated pre-breeding body condition as a function of a body condition index and a serum chemical panel and how these parameters were associated with reproduction and survival.  No differences were found in measures of fecundity, however the expense may be incurred through survival rates, which were related to the body condition index, serum protein and uric acid concentrations. Baseline biochemistry reference ranges for pre-breeding hens were established. These values varied by year and capture technique. Annual variation may be linked to precipitation and forage quality. Elevated creatinine kinase and chloride levels occurred in females captured by the CODA net-launcher in comparison to females captured by night-spotlighting. Differential biochemical values may have been caused by stress or diurnal variation in serum chemistry.  Diseases tested included avian influenza, Salmonella pullorum/ S. typhoid, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, M. synoviae, and M meleagridis. Individual grouse tested positive for M. synoviae, however there was no consistency of lab results among years, laboratories, or blood storage method. Additionally, no relationship between disease occurrence and reproduction or survival was detected and false positives have been reported with the plate agglutination-screening test. Given this information, the serology results need to be viewed cautiously as they were based on questionable disease incidence.","Thesis (M.S., Wildlife Resources), University of Idaho, July 2003.

ir0010,"Ecology of Greater Sage-Grouse in South-Central Owyhee County, Idaho","Wik, Paul A.",2002,"Breeding populations of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) have been reduced 17- 47%, which is thought to be a result of over-exploitation, habitat loss, and habitat degradation. The seasonal habitats, movements, and survival of sage-grouse populations in southwest Idaho were poorly understood, and this lack of information hindered planning efforts of the United States Air Force (U.S.A.F.), which received approval for training sites to be constructed in Owyhee County beginning in 1999. This research was designed to help assess potential effects in sage-grouse from these activities. My primary objectives were to assess whether sage-grouse were affected by the construction of U.S.A.F. Enhanced Training in Idaho (ETI) sites and obtain baseline  ecological data on the population and habitats.  Male and female sage-grouse were captured and fitted with necklace-style radio transmitters in 1999, 2000, and 2001 to determine survival, movements, and success from nests and broods. Annual survival rates for males were 0.54 (n = 14, 1999/2000, September 1999- August 2000) and 0.61 (n = 17, 2000/2001, i.e. September 2000- August 2001), with seasonal survival rates ranging from 0.76- 1.00 for all seasons (Seasons were: Sept- Nov, Dec- Feb, Mar- May, and June- Aug) and years. Adult female sage grouse annual survival rates were 0.58 (n = 21, 1999/2000) and 0.42 (n = 38, 2000/2001). Sub-adults (10 weeks of age to 15 months) survival rates were 0.22 (n = 16, 1999/2000) and 0.55 (n = 18, 2000/2001). Seasonal rates ranged from 0.74- 1.00 for adults and from 0.40- 1.00 for sub-adults. Nest success was 43% (9 of 21, 2000) and 50% (8 of 16, 2001) with an average first clutch size of 6.5 ± 0.27 (95% C.l.). In 2000, 20% of the hens that lost their first nest renested (2 of 10) and no estimates of renesting could be obtained for 2001. Nests were placed under taller shrubs (P ~ 0.001) with greater shrub cover (P ~ 0.001), taller  grass (P ~ 0.001), and greater cover provided by grass (P = 0.003) than randomly available.  Brood-rearing success was low in 2000 (38%) and increased in 2001 (83% ), but production from both years (0.43 and 0.66 chicks/hen in 2000 and 2001, respectively for flush counts at 7 weeks) was well below the 2.25 chicks/hen thought necessary to maintain a stable or increasing population. Hens with broods used taller (P = 0.025) shrubs with greater grass cover (P = 0.004) than was randomly available. In 2000, hens with broods used the same habitat through the brood-rearing period, whereas in 2001, hens switched habitats at the end of June. In 2001, 5 forbs were identified to occur more frequently in habitats used by broods in the early brood-rearing season (4- 5 weeks posthatch), and 4 forbs were identified to occur more frequently at brood sites in the late brood-rearing period. Most birds moved south to southwest from spring to summer range. Males tended to use higher elevation habitats during the summer and females used the upland shrubs and agricultural fields centered around the community of Riddle, Idaho. Females moved an average of 1.7 ± 0.42 km (95% C.l.) from lek of capture to nest, with renests averaging 790 m (240- 1300m) from the first nest. Mean distance moved from spring range to summer range for males was 23.9 ± 2.13 km (95% C.l., ages combined) and 17.0 ± 1.44 km (95% C.l., ages combined) for females. Males moved farther than females (P = 0.027) to reach their summer range. Decay rates of sage grouse intestinal droppings were examined to determine whether they could be used as a sampling tool for detecting  changes in habitat use.   Droppings were placed in 3 habitats (A. t. wyomingensis, A. arbuscula, and Agropyron cristatum) in groups of piles and singles. Single droppings decayed at a similar rate (P = . 0.702) among the 3 habitats, but piles decayed slower (P = 0.051) in the A. arbuscula habitat than the other 2 habitats during 734 days of exposure. Using dropping counts for detecting changes in sage grouse use is viable with count intervals 1 year. Insufficient data had been collected to determine whether any effects from the construction of the U.S.A.F. sites occurred. Additional data will be collected on dropping counts placed around 4 Enhanced Training in Idaho (ETI) sites constructed by the U.S.A.F. during 1999-2001 to continue assessing this issue.","Thesis (M.S., Wildlife Resources) -- University of Idaho, December 2002.

The question then arose as to whether this species was a single taxon as considered by Ward (1953) and Cronquist (1955) with a wide ecologic amplitude or a complex with two distinct subspecies at treated by Beetle (1960).  The study was initiated principally to determine the ecologic and taxonomic status of Artemisia tridentate in British Columbia. A. tripartite ssp. tripartite was included in some of the experiments for comparison. The experiments conducted were mostly autecologic in nature but synecologic data were also taken at most of the major study sites so that the autocologic data could be related to these.   This investigation is of particular scientific interest for at least two reasons. First, the study area represents the northern extent of the occurrence of these species and the results obtained may contribute to the understanding of sagebrush ecology in other areas. Second, the autecology of sagebrush in this region has never been studied.","Thesis (M.S., Range Management) -- University of Idaho, 1964. Major professor: Tisdale, E.

ir0013,Rural Idaho Since the Recession,University of Idaho McClure Center for Public Policy Research,2015,"Idaho is in the 6th year of recovery since the 2007-09 recession. This report explores how rural parts of the state which account for about one-third of Idahoans are recovering from the economic downturn.   Since the recession ended, population growth in rural Idaho has been flat, growing less than 1%. In contrast, urban Idaho has grown by 6%, led by growth in Ada, Canyon, and Kootenai counties (8.6%, 7.5%, and 6.4%, respectively).  Most of Idaho's rural counties experienced net out-migration between 2010 and 2014, meaning that more people moved out than moved in.  Since 2010, rural Idaho's Hispanic population has grown while its non-Hispanic population has decreased. By 2013, Hispanics made up 14% of the state's rural population.  Most of the rural counties that are growing are located in south central Idaho where agriculture is strong and has a growing workforce, and in selected counties adjacent to growing urban areas.  Both rural and urban Idaho lost jobs during the recession, and neither has returned to pre-recession levels. Since job growth began in 2010, the number of rural jobs has increased 2.6%, compared to an increase of 4.8% for urban jobs.  At least since 1990, rural parts of the state have had weaker economic performance, as measured by indicators such as unemployment rates, average wages, and per capita income. Since the recession, however, the gaps have narrowed. For example, in 2007, per capita income in rural Idaho was $4,329 lower than in urban Idaho. By 2013, the gap had decreased to $515.",Policy brief from the James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research,Rural development; Recessions--United States;,,,,,"Idaho at a Glance.

ir0014,Early Childhood Learning,University of Idaho McClure Center for Public Policy Research,2015,"The period from birth to 5 years old is a critical time for a child's brain development. In these early years, children develop cognitive, social, emotional, and linguistic skills essential to achieving success once they begin school. This report provides background for public policy dialogue on this critical birth-to-5 period in the lives of Idaho's young children. Findings include the following:   There are roughly 146,000 children under age 6 in Idaho. More than half - about 83,000 - live in households in which all parents work outside the home.  Idaho has no comprehensive system to track all places where children are being cared for when their parents are working. We have data on the number of child care slots licensed by the state and cities (about 24,000 and 8,000, respectively). However, we do not know how many of these slots are in facilities that provide opportunities for children to develop skills essential to achieving success when they begin school.   Family engagement is a key element of many early learning programs, including Head Start and Early Head Start. Other examples are ""Read to Me,"" offered through public libraries, and the Maternal Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program.  Though we lack good information on the extent of learning opportunities for Idaho's youngest children, we do know that only 54% of Idaho's kindergartners enter school ready to learn to read. This suggests Idaho's young children would benefit from more learning opportunities before they get to elementary school, both in the home and elsewhere.",Policy brief from the James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research,Rural schools; Education (Early childhood),,,,,"Idaho at a Glance.

ir0015,Refugees and Healthcare in Idaho,University of Idaho McClure Center for Public Policy Research,2014,"Between fiscal years 2007 and 2014, roughly 7,700 refugees resettled in Idaho, representing a small fraction of all refugees arriving in the United States during that time.  In 2014, about 1,050 refugees resettled in Idaho, higher than the state's 10-year average of 878 per year but below the peak of 1,214 in 2009. Refugees in Idaho are usually women and children who resettle in either the Boise or Twin Falls area. Refugees come to Idaho from several continents, bringing an array of languages, cultures, and religions. This report focuses on how refugees in Idaho engage in the healthcare system and the distinct health concerns they face. The following key findings are based on interviews with service providers, federal data, and literature reviews:   Refugees are more likely to present long-term, unmet health needs due to prolonged lack of care prior to their arrival in the U.S. The nature of these concerns often necessitates long-term care or extensive treatment, in turn generating high costs that may be unaffordable for those without health insurance.  Refugee access to healthcare is impeded by cost and cultural differences related to how refugees perceive health problems and healthcare.  Refugees who are not eligible for Idaho's Medicaid program can receive medical coverage through the federally funded Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA) program. Those who receive RMA typically lose their coverage after eight months but can re-apply.  Like other legal U.S. residents, refugees may not qualify to purchase subsidized health insurance on the Health Insurance Marketplace, depending on their income level.  Several agencies and organizations in Idaho aid refugees by increasing access and affordability of healthcare, especially through culturally appropriate care models.",Policy brief from the James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research,Rural health; Refugees,,,,,"Idaho at a Glance.

This is the main conclusion from our 2014 likely voter survey on Idaho's roads and bridges. Key findings include the following:  Likely voters generally view roads and bridges as adequate today but not for ten years from now.  Almost all likely voters see a relationship between the economy, on one hand, and roads and bridges, on the other.  Roughly half of likely voters say that increasing funding for roads and bridges should be among the state legislature's top three priorities.  A substantial majority of likely voters is convinced by arguments about safety and the economic importance of roads and bridges, but less convinced by arguments about high taxes and government waste.  Revenue sources for which voter support is highest are those that are less likely to generate significant amounts of funding.",Policy brief from the James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research,Rural development; Roads; Bridges,,,,,"Idaho at a Glance.

ir0017,Food Security in Idaho,University of Idaho McClure Center for Public Policy Research,2014,"Food insecurity has serious long-term consequences for health, educational outcomes, workforce participation, and income. Despite considerable resources devoted to reducing hunger, 22% of Idaho's children were food insecure in 2012 and 14% of Idaho households were food insecure during the period 2010-2012. Rates of food insecurity are especially severe among children and in rural Idaho. The goal of this policy brief is to create a base of common information and stimulate partnerships to address the food security challenge. A full research report on food security in Idaho is available on the McClure Center's website (see below). In Idaho and other states, there are five approaches to improving food security:  Federal food and nutrition programs provide financial assistance, supplemental food, and other services to families. They are administered by the state of Idaho. Charitable organizations use donations from individuals and companies to provide emergency food assistance and other services.  Nutrition education programs are funded from federal and other sources to encourage more nutritious eating, primarily among low-income families.  Advocacy and policy approaches promote changes in the principles and priorities that guide laws and programs.  Market-based approaches work to connect local food producers with low-income consumers, sometimes through or with subsidies from nonprofit or public agencies. Our analysis points toward four priorities that should guide policy and programs aimed at improving long-term food security: collaboration, focusing on children first, stimulating new markets wherever possible, and using evidence-based education strategies.",Policy brief from the James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research,Rural health; Food security,,,,,"Idaho at a Glance.

Some, but not all, live on reservations; some go to tribal schools while others attend public schools. This report focuses on Native students' enrollment, academic achievement, post-secondary education, and educational attainment. Major findings point to the need for improving education outcomes:   The gap between Native and non-Native students on achievement tests is persistent.   Native students are less likely than others to be college-ready in math and reading.   Native adults have lower levels of educational attainment than non-Native adults.   Native enrollment at Idaho's post-secondary institutions is increasing, but shifting away from 4-year institutions and toward 2-year institutions and certificate programs.   This report also highlights a few of the many education efforts of Idaho's tribes. Tribes are working with public schools to implement place-based education that incorporates cultural knowledge and language into hands-on projects that also help students meet state education requirements. Many tribal leaders view education as a life-long process essential not only to preparing for a career, but also carrying on a tribe's cultural knowledge, language, and traditions.",Policy brief from the James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research,Rural schools; Indians of North America,,,,,"Idaho at a Glance.

To learn about internet use in rural Idaho, we surveyed a representative sample in Lemhi and Idaho counties (see ""About the Survey,"" back panel). These two counties are typical of sparsely populated, mountainous areas in Idaho and thus provide insights into challenges related to rural internet use. Our findings indicate that while most rural households in the Lemhi/Idaho region subscribe to the internet and are satisfied with their providers, a sizable group has problems related to poor connectivity and slow speeds.",Policy brief from the James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research,Rural public utilities; Broadband communication systems--United States,,,,,"Idaho at a Glance.

Our major findings point to the need for programs and policies that help Hispanic students achieve their highest potential:  Hispanic enrollment growth is outpacing non-Hispanic growth in Idaho's public schools, colleges and universities.   Hispanic students have high aspirations for completing a post-secondary degree. Almost two-thirds expect to complete a 4-year college degree.  Despite their aspirations, Hispanic students do not perform as well as non-Hispanics on state achievement tests, especially in science.  When it comes to experiences with science and math, Hispanic 7th graders are similar to their non-Hispanic peers. By 10th grade, however, Hispanic students are less likely to have positive experiences.

We also found that among Idaho's high school students, Hispanics are about twice as likely as others to report that they tried smoking or alcohol at an early age. They are less likely to play on a sports team. The ACA could significantly reduce health disparities between Hispanics and other Idahoans. More Hispanics will have access to health insurance, which research shows is associated with many benefits. These include greater use of preventive care and care for chronic  conditions; higher life expectancy; fewer complications from disease; and fewer deaths from treatable causes.

The recession didn't hit rural Idaho until about a year later, when some small communities began to experience very steep declines. The hardest hit counties in the state - all rural - are located in central and northern Idaho. Rural counties that are more dependent on agriculture, mainly in the south, are weathering the recession better than the state as a whole. Though some small communities have been hit hard, employment trends in rural Idaho have generally been more stable than in urban parts of the state. Employment in rural Idaho has tended to grow less during boom times and decline more slowly during recessionary periods.

Compared to other districts in Idaho, rural districts: tend to have lower enrollments; are more likely to be losing students; tend to spend more per student, despite lower teacher salaries; tend to have smaller class sizes; are more successful at meeting No Child Left Behind targets; and are much more likely to be adopting four-day school weeks. Over one-fourth of Idaho's K-12 students are rural.

ir0029,Profile of Rural Idaho,University of Idaho McClure Center for Public Policy Research,2005,"Change truly is the one constant on which we can depend. If there is any question, travel throughout rural Idaho. Seasons change, challenges change and communities change. Some change is positive, some managed and some is out of our control. As human beings, it is our duty to seek change that is best for ourselves, neighbors, community and state. We must get ahead of the change and direct it when we can, adapt to the change we cannot control and maintain a positive approach throughout. One of the most powerful ways to influence positive change is through partnership. Sitting down with people from divergent backgrounds to work toward a common goal of creating change or adapting to it benefits everyone who participates. The Profile of Rural Idaho represents the power of partnership. The University of Idaho and Idaho Commerce & Labor invested greatly to gather, assess and organize the data. Numerous people from a   variety of federal, state and private entities helped through the Profile writing process. Idaho Rural Partnership (IRP) provided resources and technology and financed printing. The Profile is a tangible example of IRP's mission to join diverse public and private resources for innovative collaborations to strengthen communities and improve life in rural Idaho. The coalition of federal, state, local and private partners recognizes the importance of this profile and the possible positive changes that come from understanding the data. However, the true collaboration comes now. The information represents the dynamic changes experienced in rural Idaho. Population fluctuations, rural economies and employment, agriculture and natural resource management issues, and educating   Idaho's young people are challenges highlighted in the Profile of Rural Idaho. The issues are the impetus for divergent groups to gather with a single goal: How can Idahoans work together to improve the quality of life in this State? How can federal, state, private, and non-profit groups enter the realm of give-and-take, consensus building, collaboration, and ultimately partnership? The process starts by critically assessing the data, setting aside agendas and entering the discussion asking, �What is best for rural Idaho?� This is the fourth Profile of Rural Idaho. The data is collected and assembled every five years. We are  most grateful to authors Priscilla Salant and Alan Porter. They, and respective staff, also researched the data. Salant works in the area of rural policy and assessment in the Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology Department at the University of Idaho. Porter is the manager of information services in the  Communications & Research Division of Idaho Commerce & Labor. Christine Dearien and Debbie Gray, research analysts with the University of Idaho, and Tony Tenne, economic development analyst with Idaho Commerce & Labor, also researched the data and offered technical assistance.

Population grew by 29 percent from 1990 to 2000, from 1 million residents to almost 1.3 million, the fifth fastest rate in the nation. On an annual basis, our growth rate peaked in 1993 at a remarkable 3.5 percent. Hispanics made up 8 percent of the population in 2000 and accounted for 17 percent of the growth that occured during the 1990s. These trends played out differently across rural Idaho. The population of most rural counties grew at a moderate rate, while a few grew rapidly and two, Shoshone and Butte, lost population. Most rural counties bordering the state's urban areas grew, sometimes dramatically. Several rural counties grew enough to be reclassified as metropolitan.

Smoke is regulated by a web of interrelated federal and state laws and regulations designed to protect human health and welfare. Many forest managers agree that using prescribed fire can have less adverse effects on air quality than allowing wildland fires to burn forests under uncontrolled conditions. A policy question arises: Are the laws and regulations that protect air quality flexible enough to allow for increased smoke from prescribed fires in the short-term in order to prevent worse air quality from unplanned wildland fires in the future?

Cook; Jay O'Laughlin,2003,"The future of Idahos rural communities can be viewed two ways, based on two models of how communities use forest resources for economic development. One view is that commodity production drives economic developmentharvesting timber and manufacturing lumber, plywood, paper, and other wood products from it. The other viewpoint relies on amenity values associated with the forestsscenery, wildlife, recreation, etc.to attract people to visit or move to Idaho, bringing money or skills that in turn drive economic development. In this report, we analyze Idahos rural communities for evidence to support the commodity-based and amenity-based models of economic development.

One response to such wildfire problems is to design and implement fuel treatments in an attempt to reduce the severity of effects from wildfires. Fuel treatments lessen the amount of fuel available for burning and/or rearrange fuels to increase the probability that they burn with less intensity.

ir0075,Idaho's Endowment Lands: A Matter of Sacred Trust,Jay O'Laughlin,1990,"A distinction must be made between the management objectives established by law for federal public lands in Idaho and the objectives for Idaho's state lands. State lands were acquired from the federal government under a trust agreement whereby proceeds from the disposal or use of the lands would exclusively benefit certain designated public institutions, primarily public schools. This trust arrangement is clearly defined in law and has stood many legal challenges. However, certain individuals and groups tend to either confuse or ignore the fundamental difference in the management objectives of these two categories of public lands. They contend that Idaho's state lands should be managed for a variety of purposes to benefit a variety of groups and individuals, much as federal land is managed.  The review of pertinent law in this report indicates that the notion of managing the grant lands for a wide variety of purposes and public benefits seems to violate both federal and state law. These lands were granted to the state for the purpose of establishing a perpetual endowment for specific beneficiaries, mainly the public schools. As a matter of trust, the state is obligated to sell, lease, exchange, or manage the grant lands, producing full value (now defined as ""maximum long term financial return"") from them only to benefit the specific institutions designated by law as trust beneficiaries.",Policy Analysis Group Report - University of Idaho College of Natural Resources,state land; environmental policy,,,,,,,Text,application/pdf,en,,"In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted.

Because of that, and other threats, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has proposed adding sage-grouse to the list of species protected by the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA), a decision that will be finalized in September 2015. The State of Idaho's goal is to prevent the ESA listing by identifying conservation activities intended to ensure the long-term viability of sage-grouse in the state. An effective strategy to reduce the wildfire/invasives threat would include actions for: (1) protecting existing habitat by managing fuels, establishing fuel breaks, and restricting travel; (2) responding quickly to wildfires, using early detection methods and having the right resources in the right places at the right times; and (3) preventing invasive species from gaining footholds, which is best done by protecting existing habitat from wildfires and responding quickly to wildfires. An ESA listing will not be prevented unless such actions are adequately ensured by regulatory mechanisms.

Reducing the risk of DS transmitting fatal respiratory disease to BHS involves separating BHS and DS to prevent contact between these sheep cousins. Separation can adversely affect some DS operations. The main problem addressed herein is BHS/DS interaction. We describe 1) federal and state decision processes and events for BHS conservation that affect DS grazing in the vicinity of BHS, 2) the participants involved in those processes and their perspectives, and 3) the information they rely on.

By providing the people of Idaho with a guide to understanding the land grant endowment trusts administered by the Idaho State Board of Land Commissioners (Land Board) this report, like its first edition in 1990, attempts to overcome that problem. The body of assets (or ""corpus"") in the endowment trusts consists of three principal assets: 2.5 million acres of land managed by the Idaho Department of Lands (IDL), a Permanent Fund consisting of financial assets that ""shall forever remain inviolate and intact,"" and an Earnings Reserve Fund from which distributions are made to beneficiary institutions.

In 2014, Idaho had nearly 200,000 Hispanic residents. They made up roughly 12% of the state’s total population, compared to 17% of the nation as a whole. In terms of the share of Hispanics today, Idaho is roughly where the U.S. was in 2000, when 13% of U.S. residents were Hispanic. Most of Idaho’s Hispanics (70%) were born in the U.S., and most (79%) are U.S. citizens. Immigrants who came to the U.S. since 2010 make up only 2% of Idaho’s Hispanic population. The median age among Idaho’s Hispanics was 24 in 2014, compared to 38 among non-Hispanics. This is the first of three updated reports on Idaho’s Hispanic population.

ir0109,Life After High School,University of Idaho McClure Center for Public Policy Research,2016,"In recent years, Idaho has ranked at or near the bottom of all 50 states in terms of our “Go On” rate, that is, how many high school graduates go on for postsecondary education. In 2014, Idaho’s Go On rate for the fall after high school graduation was only 47%. To understand Idaho’s low Go On rate, in September 2015 we surveyed 385 young adults who had graduated from an Idaho high school the previous spring. We asked them what they were doing and how they made their decision about life after high school. Based on our survey and research others have done, what have we learned?   More females than males are enrolling in postsecondary education. This is true among our survey respondents, in Idaho generally, and in the U.S. as a whole. In Idaho in 2014, 53% of females went on, compared to only 38% of males.  Males and females are motivated by different considerations. Among our respondents, a higher percentage of males than females said the most important thing in deciding about life after high school was “making money.” In contrast, more females than males cited “expanding my horizons” as their most important consideration. Not all young adults in Idaho believe postsecondary education pays off. In our survey, only two-thirds of respondents strongly agreed that more education would help them get a higher paying job. The rest had at least some doubt. Parents influence their children’s decisions about life after high school. In our survey, a significantly higher percentage of respondents whose parents had at least some postsecondary education went on after high school than those whose parents did not. And among respondents who went on, 75% said parents were the most influential people when it came to deciding what to do after high school.",Policy brief from the James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research,Education,,,,,"Idaho at a Glance.

ir0110,Analysis of Landslide Occurences in Idaho,"Adams, Wayne C.",1988,"The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate the relation between landslides in Idaho and several related site conditions. In this landslide study I gathered information from landslide sites in order to attain two goals. The first goal was to evaluate the number of failures associated with earth-materials. The second goal was to determine the site characteristics that are most likely to promote failure in these materials. I propose that a simple inventory of site conditions from known landslides coupled with a careful data analysis can direct an investigator to a particular earth-material that has significant landsliding potential. The scope of the study involved an analysis of the site conditions from over 1500 landslides. The methods used in this analysis of landslides were based on the following set of nine interactive site conditions: elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, rock type or material origin, presence of formational contact, presence of mapped fault, square mile area, precipitation and snow load. The initial data gathering was completed for the Landslide Inventory of Idaho, a project funded by the Idaho Geological Survey and the U.S. Geological Survey. The landslides were categorized by the ""naturally occurring"" materials at the failure site. The data describing each landslide site were gleaned from several sources and map scales. The precipitation and snow load values were assigned after the initial inventory using a weighted averaging technique based on the spatial dependence of the values.","Thesis (M.S., Geological Engineering) -- University of Idaho, 1988",landslides,,Geological Engineering,,,,text,Text,application/pdf,en,,"In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted.

The region is home to about 70 percent of Idaho's dairy cows and 10 percent of its residents. In the original study and in the update, we examine community impacts from a demographic, economic, and social perspective. Both studies were funded by grants from the Idaho Dairymen's Association. For the 2017 study, we conducted 48 semi-structured interviews with experts and key-informants selected based on their knowledge of the region, its communities, and the dairy industry. In addition to our interviews, we also analyzed secondary data from federal, state, and local sources. These data provide important context to help understand themes, trends, and patterns that emerge from qualitative interviews, and vice versa. Two key national trends form the context for this report. The first is a continuation of decades-long structural change in the dairy industry, towards fewer and larger farms. The second is slowing growth in the Hispanic population, largely the result of lower birth rates (in both Mexico and the U.S.) and a dramatic decline in the number of Mexican immigrants entering the U.S.",Research report from the James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research,Dairy products industry; Idaho,,,,,,text,Text,application/pdf,en,,"In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted.

Idaho Hispanics make up 12% of the total population, 18% of K-12 public school students, 2% of Idaho public school teachers, 12% of the labor force, 27% of the uninsured, and 3% of registered voters. Three-fourths of Idaho's Hispanics were born in the U.S., and 9-in-10 live south of a line from Payette County to Madison and Bonneville counties. Hispanics accounted for 30% of the state's population growth between 2010 and 2015, 42% of K-12 public school enrollment growth between the 2010-11 and 2015-16 school years, and 37% of employment growth between 2009 and 2015. However, Hispanic population growth in Idaho is slowing. On an annual basis, the population grew 9% in the 1990s, 7% in the 2000s, and 2% from 2010-2015. In terms of education, Idaho Hispanic students are less proficient in basic subjects and less prepared for college and career than non-Hispanics, based on standardized test scores. Students in the English Learner program score the lowest on standardized tests. Compared to non-Hispanics, Hispanics in Idaho have higher unemployment and poverty rates. They also have lower average annual wages and household income. However, their economic well-being has improved since the recession. The Hispanic unemployment rate is down 8 percentage points; the non-Hispanic rate is down 4 points. The Hispanic poverty rate is down 5 percentage points; the non-Hispanic rate is up 1.5 points. The number of employed Hispanics is up 34%; the number of employed non-Hispanics is up 6%. What accounts for these findings? First, Hispanics are more likely to be in the labor force and to work in growing occupations and industries. Second, the number of Hispanics in the labor force is going up in all age categories, but going down among non-Hispanics under age 25 and age 25-54. It may also be that younger Hispanic workers are becoming more educated and likely to work non-traditional, higher paying jobs.

Two parallel trends shape the context for this analysis. Both are consistent with national trends in farm?dependent areas of the country. First, the structure of Idaho�s dairy industry is changing.

People with poor diets are far more likely to experience poor overall health status, activity-limiting health impairments, depression and other mental health issues. Children with poor diets experience compromised health and development and are less likely to succeed in school, while adults who experienced childhood hunger are more likely to miss work and have a harder time holding down a job. People with poor diets are also more vulnerable to being overweight and obese. They have lower incomes, less access to affordable, healthy foods, and fewer options for physical activity. We have two goals in writing this report. First, we aim to create a base of common information about Idaho�s food security challenge and how it is currently being addressed. Second, we seek to encourage organizations and agencies to collaborate around a common agenda to improve food security in Idaho. In achieving these goals, we also aim to identify the best ways in which the University of Idaho can work with partners to address Idaho�s food security challenge.",Research report from the James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research,Food security; Idaho,,,,,,text,Text,application/pdf,en,,"In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted.

This chapter is not here to tie a nice little bow around the book's contents and declare everything well and good.

ir0135,Recreation Access and Leasing of State Endowment Lands,"Cook, Philip S.;  Benedum, Michelle;  Becker, Dennis R.",2016-09-01,,"(PAG Issue Brief, no. 19) The Idaho State Board of Land Commissioners (Land Board) is trustee for 2.4 million acres of endowment lands managed for the benefit of public schools and other institutions with the constitutional mandate of maximizing long term financial return. Currently, Idaho does not charge for recreating on endowment lands, nor have endowment lands been leased for exclusive recreational purposes. Recent Land Board discussions have raised the issue of recreation on the endowment lands and its relationship to fiduciary responsibility, as well as the Board has received requests for leasing exclusive hunting rights on some endowment lands. The purpose of this report is to inform discussion in Idaho about exclusive leasing and access fees for recreation on endowment lands by comparing policies adopted in other states.  Of the 18 states with trust lands for which we were able to find information, four do not allow general recreation access to the public (Colorado, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas), 10 allow general recreation access to the public without a fee (Alabama, Alaska, Idaho, Minnesota, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin, Wyoming), and four allow general recreation access to the public with a fee (Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, Washington). Ten of the 18 states allow exclusive leasing of trust lands for recreation (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Wyoming). In four states, the state wildlife management agency pays the state land trust for hunting access (Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Utah).  We were unable to find program cost information for any recreation permit or lease program, which would include the cost of administering permits, enforcement, and associated costs. Net revenue is therefore unknown, but in most cases reported total revenue amounts do not leave much leeway for administrative or enforcement costs before program costs would outweigh revenues.",Idaho; recreation; public lands; land trusts; public policy; outdoor recreation,,University of Idaho.

Schitsu’umsh knowledge and practice is called hnkhwelkhwlnet, “our ways of life in the world,” and is conveyed through acts of re-telling their oral traditions and stories. For the Schitsu’umsh, storytelling is a living act and can only truly occur in-person as a shared experience between the storyteller and listeners as active participants. While a simulation of this active in-person exchange, this 3-D  Landscape provides a storytelling experience that attempts to replicates how hnkhwelkhwlnet can be accessed and understood. This format more effectively expresses indigenous meaning than a literacy-based format. Conveyed in the 3-D Landscape are insights into this unique indigenous form of knowledge and practice and how it has provided a means for Schitsu’umsh to successfully adapt to various forms of environmental and social change. Schitsu’umsh hnkhwelkhwlnet offers insights into how the indigenous and the scientific, in concert with each other, can be applied to address climate change. In offering this 3-D Landscape to the public, the Schitsu’umsh invite you to participate in this story, interact with its content, and see for yourself what mi’yp, lessons, about their hnkhwelkhwlnet are revealed to you.

In this module you will be introduced to the Nimíipuu, also called the Nez Perce. We have a rich and vibrant culture, which has existed since time immemorial and which continues to this day. As a result of your engagement in this module, you will gain a better understanding of the influence of the Nimíipuu not only on Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery, but also on American history and culture. You will also gain an appreciation of how the Corps of Discovery impacted the Nimíipuu.     From our perspective, that of the Nimíipuu, you can glimpse our aboriginal culture before the arrival of the Corps of Discovery, and how it has continued to this day. You will then explore the significance of the arrival of Lewis and Clark among our people. How did we, the Nimíipuu, view the ""discovery"" of these strangers and the new world they brought with them? But as Lewis and Clark simply opened the door to a new and critical relationship with the American people, you can also explore what followed in the wake of Lewis and Clark. How did the missionaries, military generals, and treaty commissioners impact the Nimíipuu?

From our perspective what does it mean today to be a Schitsu'umsh, or, as we are also known, a Coeur d'Alene Indian? This is the overriding question addressed in this module. To help you answer this question, the continuing cultural vitality of our people, from the time of Lewis and Clark to the present, will be considered.     May 6th, 1806 was a most momentous day for us, the Schitsu'umsh. It was on that day that William Clark wrote in his journal and provided the first suyepmsh (white men) descriptions of a people he called, ""Skeets-so-mish"" and of a lake he named, ""Waytom Lake"" (later renamed Lake Coeur d'Alene). With the penning of those words the world of the Schitsu'umsh was ""discovered"" and would soon collide with that of the suyepmsh and be forever changed. Since time immemorial the Lake Coeur d’Alene has been the spiritual and cultural anchoring for the Schitsu'umsh. Following in the wake of the Corps of Discovery, the lake and our people would face a steady stream of challenges, from the introduction of deadly diseases, to the arrival of Jesuit missionaries, then from the military generals and treaty commissioners, followed by river and lake pollution from mining contamination, and the onslaught continues. But as you will see and hear in this module, the story of the Schitsu'umsh is one of resilience and resurgence in the face of adversity. The kinship ties among our families and with the lake and rivers continue to be strong.     Of special note in this module will be the wealth of oral traditions shared with you by our elders - the stories of our creation and the songs we sing. In so doing you will glimpse into the very special relationship we, the Schitsu'umsh people, have with Lake Coeur d'Alene and its interconnected rivers and mountains. Also of importance in this module is consideration of our Schitsu'umsh epistemology, what we call ""heart knowledge."" Understanding how we come to ""know"" and ""relate to"" our world is a key to understanding what it means to be Schitsu'umsh and an Indian.
