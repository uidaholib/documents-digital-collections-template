mcclure-center-0005,Community Level Impacts of Idaho's Changing Dairy Industry,2009,Priscilla Salant; J.D. Wulfhorst; Stephanie Kane; Christine Dearien,Research Reports,,"This report analyzes the community-level impacts of Idaho’s changing dairy industry, and specifically, that part of the industry involved in milk production. Using a three-part methodology, we examine how the people who work on dairy farms impact local economies, schools, health care providers, justice systems, and other aspects of communities in southern Idaho.

Two parallel trends shape the context for this analysis. Both are consistent with national trends in farm-dependent areas of the country. First, the structure of Idaho’s dairy industry is changing. The trend is towards larger and more geographically concentrated farms with an increasing demand for wage labor. Second, Idaho is becoming more ethnically diverse as the state’s Hispanic population grows at a faster rate than the rest of the population.","James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research, University of Idaho",eng,Text,application/pdf,https://www.uidaho.edu/-/media/UIdaho-Responsive/Files/president/direct-reports/mcclure-center/Research-Reports/community-impacts-dairy-2009.pdf,,community-impacts-dairy-2009.pdf,pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/community-impacts-dairy-2009.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/small/community-impacts-dairy-2009_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/thumbs/community-impacts-dairy-2009_th.jpg,"In copyright, educational use permitted.

mcclure-center-0018,Towards Food Security in Idaho,2014,Priscilla Salant; Christy Dearien; Erinn Cruz,Research Reports,,"Food insecurity causes serious long-term problems for individuals and society as a whole. People with poor diets are far more likely to experience poor overall health status, activity-limiting health impairments, depression and other mental health issues. Children with poor diets experience compromised health and development and are less likely to succeed in school, while adults who experienced childhood hunger are more likely to miss work and have a harder time holding down a job. People with poor diets are also more vulnerable to being overweight and obese. They have lower incomes, less access to affordable, healthy foods, and fewer options for physical activity.

We have two goals in writing this report. First, we aim to create a base of common information about Idaho’s food security challenge and how it is currently being addressed. Second, we seek to encourage organizations and agencies to collaborate around a common agenda to improve food security in Idaho. In achieving these goals, we also aim to identify the best ways in which the University of Idaho can work with partners to address Idaho’s food security challenge.","James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research, University of Idaho",eng,Text,application/pdf,https://www.uidaho.edu/-/media/UIdaho-Responsive/Files/president/direct-reports/mcclure-center/Research-Reports/Towards-Food-Security-in-Idaho.pdf,,Towards-Food-Security-in-Idaho.pdf,pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/Towards-Food-Security-in-Idaho.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/small/towards-food-security-in-idaho_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/thumbs/towards-food-security-in-idaho_th.jpg,"In copyright, educational use permitted.

This consolidated structure offers an important platform for education sectors to join forces toward making improvements from kindergarten through graduate school. In June, 2017, 31 high school career and college counselors and postsecondary academic advisors and career counselors used this consolidated platform to consider the persistently low rate of Idahoans earning postsecondary credentials and to offer recommendations for improvement. These educators gathered for a three-day Idaho’s Future Initiative (IFI) meeting in Boise, examined the student pipeline from eighth grade through the first postsecondary year, and drafted nine recommendations to present to the State Board. Educators at this invitation-only event represented every region of the state, every size of high school, and every one of the state’s eight public colleges and universities. One hundred percent of the Idaho’s Future Initiative (IFI) participants have expressed interest in building a statewide structure to allow high school and postsecondary counselors and advisors to work together to implement these or other improvements.","James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research, University of Idaho",eng,Text,application/pdf,https://www.uidaho.edu/-/media/UIdaho-Responsive/Files/president/direct-reports/mcclure-center/Research-Reports/idaho-futures-report.pdf,,idaho-futures-report.pdf,pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/idaho-futures-report.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/small/idaho-futures-report_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/thumbs/idaho-futures-report_th.jpg,"In copyright, educational use permitted.

The region is home to about 70 percent of Idaho’s dairy cows and 10 percent of its residents. In the original study and in the update, we examine community impacts from a demographic, economic, and social perspective. Both studies were funded by grants from the Idaho Dairymen’s Association.

For the 2017 study, we conducted 48 semi-structured interviews with experts and keyinformants selected based on their knowledge of the region, its communities, and the dairy industry. In addition to our interviews, we also analyzed secondary data from federal, state, and local sources. These data provide important context to help understand themes, trends, and patterns that emerge from qualitative interviews, and vice versa. Two key national trends form the context for this report. The first is a continuation of decadeslong structural change in the dairy industry, towards fewer and larger farms. The second is slowing growth in the Hispanic population, largely the result of lower birth rates (in both Mexico and the U.S.) and a dramatic decline in the number of Mexican immigrants entering the U.S.","James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research, University of Idaho",eng,Text,application/pdf,https://www.uidaho.edu/-/media/UIdaho-Responsive/Files/president/direct-reports/mcclure-center/Research-Reports/community-impacts-dairy-2017.pdf,,community-impacts-dairy-2017.pdf,pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/community-impacts-dairy-2017.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/small/community-impacts-dairy-2017_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/thumbs/community-impacts-dairy-2017_th.jpg,"In copyright, educational use permitted.

The changing climate carries implications for planning, policy, and social impacts at the international, national, regional, state, and local levels. Concerns surrounding energy and climate center around the availability of primary energy resources necessary for an increasing population and increasing electricity consumption in commercial and household heating and cooling. The relationships among climate, energy production, and the economy are complex. There is a reinforcing loop between energy and the economy; as the economy grows, more energy is required for both production and consumption. Increased energy demand can exceed available output, creating a secondary balancing loop between the economy and energy; as prices increase, costs of economic output also increase and overall output is decreased.","James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research, University of Idaho",eng,Text,application/pdf,https://www.uidaho.edu/-/media/UIdaho-Responsive/Files/president/direct-reports/mcclure-center/iceia/iceia-energy-report-2021.pdf,,iceia-energy-report-2021.pdf,pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/iceia-energy-report-2021.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/small/iceia-energy-report-2021_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/thumbs/iceia-energy-report-2021_th.jpg,"In copyright, educational use permitted.

mcclure-center-0054,Forests Technical Report,2021,Jeffrey A. Hicke; Greg Latta,Idaho Climate-Economy Impacts Assessment,Land,"The forests of Idaho have long played a fundamental role for inhabitants. They have provided shelter; sustenance; jobs in silviculture, logging, and manufacturing; the land base upon which homes and structures have been built; and areas for hunting and recreation. Decades of wildfire suppression coupled with federal forest policy changes in the 1990s have created forest conditions susceptible to increased risk of wildfire, insects, and disease, exacerbated by an increasingly warm and dry climate. The increased risks, and various ownerships’ responses to increased risk, have important impacts on the state’s forest resources and economy. To understand the potential economic risks to Idaho forests from climate change, it is necessary to understand the underlying resource base and ownership structure. This report first takes a brief look at the forest land base and resource characteristics, and how they have changed in the recent past. It then presents the contributions to Idaho’s economy through timber harvesting and forest products manufacturing. After that, the report identifies how forests are affected by climate change, and provides an overview of studies that explore climate change impacts. The final section lays out mitigation and adaption options.","James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research, University of Idaho",eng,Text,application/pdf,https://www.uidaho.edu/-/media/UIdaho-Responsive/Files/president/direct-reports/mcclure-center/iceia/iceia-forests-report-2021.pdf,,iceia-forests-report-2021.pdf,pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/iceia-forests-report-2021.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/small/iceia-forests-report-2021_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/thumbs/iceia-forests-report-2021_th.jpg,"In copyright, educational use permitted.

mcclure-center-0058,Ecosystems and Species Report,2021,Kaylee Carr; Jeffrey A. Hicke,Idaho Climate-Economy Impacts Assessment,Land,"Idaho’s ecosystems can be characterized in different ways, including a) resilience, a measure of human modification, diversity of microclimates, and ecological representativeness; b) connectivity and climate flow; and c) biodiversity value. Much of Idaho is considered resilient, with ecosystems that are connected, allow movement of species, and recognized for biodiversity value. Agricultural and urban areas in northern and southern Idaho are designated least resilient, less connected, and of less significance in terms of biodiversity value. Areas of biodiversity value within Idaho do not always overlap areas of climate resilience, which means adaptation options will help support and facilitate continued biodiversity.

Most ecosystems are addressed elsewhere in the assessment; here we cover alpine ecosystems (i.e., locations above treeline). Climate change is expected to facilitate upward movement of treeline, thereby reducing alpine area. Some evidence for this upslope movement exists, but in some areas, movement is slower than predicted.

Many Idaho species are covered in other assessment reports. This supplemental report focuses on significant species that may be impacted by climate change. Multiple plant and animal species, including those important to tribal communities, are expected to be impacted by climate change from warming, loss of snowpack, and shifting habitat. Some species will experience range shifts in response to climate change, either upward in elevation or northward in latitude.","James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research, University of Idaho",eng,Text,application/pdf,https://www.uidaho.edu/-/media/UIdaho-Responsive/Files/president/direct-reports/mcclure-center/iceia/iceia-ecosystems-and-species-report-2021.pdf,,iceia-ecosystems-and-species-report-2021.pdf,pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/iceia-ecosystems-and-species-report-2021.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/small/iceia-ecosystems-and-species-report-2021_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/thumbs/iceia-ecosystems-and-species-report-2021_th.jpg,"In copyright, educational use permitted.

Habitat quality is predicted to decline in large rivers that support the highest quality fisheries for native natural-origin salmon and trout. Warming is predicted to expand the distributions of three key non-native species (brown trout, brook trout, and smallmouth bass), but expansions may only benefit smallmouth bass anglers in rivers; expansions of trout species will occur in small headwater streams that are rarely fished. The changing climate will affect habitats and species interactions in complex ways beyond the effects of temperature alone. Predictions for anadromous fish species are further complicated by migratory life cycles. Economic impacts will depend on changes in fish distribution; fish traits, such as size and abundance; angler access and activity; feedback patterns between climate effects; changes in socio-ecological drivers; climate mitigation actions (e.g., riparian management, instream flow regulation); and economic costs and benefits of conservation and management action, including Endangered Species Act (ESA) listings.","James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research, University of Idaho",eng,Text,application/pdf,https://www.uidaho.edu/-/media/UIdaho-Responsive/Files/president/direct-reports/mcclure-center/iceia/iceia-fish-report-2021.pdf,,iceia-fish-report-2021.pdf,pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/iceia-fish-report-2021.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/small/iceia-fish-report-2021_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/mcclure-center/thumbs/iceia-fish-report-2021_th.jpg,"In copyright, educational use permitted.
