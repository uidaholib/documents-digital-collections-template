Instead of the standard t-shirt or towel, we have, in limited supply, Team MosCon headbands. We chose headbands in part to provide our membership with a handy place to attach their nametags while in the jacuzzi, and also as a  method of identifying the Con-com. (Ours are blue.) The idea was inspired by the film, Buckaroo Banzai. The Team MosCon logo was designed by Jacqualynn Duram and the Japanese was caligraphed by Ellen Thisted. The Japanese is pronounced, ""Tsumetai mizu patororu-tai"" and means ""Cold Water Patrol."" Get one quick.
