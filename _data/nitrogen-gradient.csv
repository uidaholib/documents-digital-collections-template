ng_001,Tree DBH and Height,Tree DBH and Height,,,"Tree numbers <200 indicate the main 30 m x 30 m measurement plots. Tree numbers of 500 or greater indicate the 10 m x 10 m buffer surrounding measurement plots 1, 2 and 3 (control plots).  Plots 1 through 3 are ambient controls .  Plots 4 through 6 receive simulated experimental N deposition of 3 g N m-2 y-1. 

Diameters at breast height (dbh) are measured annually during the dormant season following each year's growing season using steel diameter tapes at permanently marked locations on each tree of 5 cm dbh and greater.  Values of -0- for dbh indicate a tree that is smaller than the minimum diameter of 5 cm.

Tree vigor indicates whether a tree is dead  (0) or alive (1) at the end of the growing season.

Occasionally, individuals in multistem trees have grown together, preventing access to dbh marks.  In these cases, either new marks are located higher in the tree or the two trees are measured as one large tree.  In either case, a period of overlap for both marks occurred, and the records for new and old marks are adjacent to each other in the database, with numbers such as ""46"" and 46.2"" (new vs original marks), or ""567, 568, and 1567"" (two original trees and combined tree after multi-stems merged).

Heights were measured in 1987, 1992, 1998, and 2005 in feet using clinometers, from two directions per tree, approximately 180 degrees apart.  Heights for other years are estimated from the linear trends between measured years.  Heights are only measured for trees on the main 30 m x 30 m plot (tree numbers < 200)

Sugar maple leaf litter was sorted from one half of one of the four 0.5 m2 litter traps placed on each study plot.   Litter was collected monthly from April through August and biweekly during the period of heavy litter fall from mid September through early November.   Sugar maple leaf litter from all collection dates for a year was composited by plot and ground for analysis.   C and N concentrations were determined using an elemental analyzer.

From 1998 through 2005, soil respiration was measured at ten locations per plot using 10 cm diameter PVC collars inserted 1 cm into the forest floor with a PP Systems EGM-2 or EGM-3. 

From 2009 through 2013, soil respiration was measured at ten locations per plot using 10 cm diameter PVC collars inserted 1 cm into the forest floor with a LiCOR 8100.   

Soil temperature was measured with a handheld probe at a 5 cm depth at each measurement location.   

Soil moisture is that recorded at a 15 cm depth using gypsum soil moisture blocks, with data logged using an DataLoggers Incorporated Easylogger (824 or 924 series).  Sensors were read every thirty minutes with averages recorded every 3 hours.  Values reported are averages for the day leading up to measurement.  Moisture values were converted to matric potential using relationships calculated for each site and depth based on response curves developed by placing moisture blocks in intact soil cores from each site/depth in a pressure plate and recording values across matric potentials ranging from -0.01 to -1.5 MPa

Soil respiration methods and results through 2001 are described in Burton et al. 2004 (Global Change Biology 10:1080-1091).

From 1998 through 2009, values are for CO2 production in nmol CO2/g/s.   Treatment codes are 0 = control;  1 = NO3 additions at 3 g N/m2/y 

Other data fields contained in the worksheets include:  study site; plot; date of measurement;  treatment (0 = control;  1 = NO3 addition at 3 g N/m2/y); measurement temperature (deg C); soil temperature at the time of respiration measurement (deg C); soil matric potential at the time of respiration measurement (MPa); root N concentration (g/kg); root C concentration (g/kg); diameter class of root sample (mm); and soil depth from which root sample was obtained (cm). 

Worksheet:  SurfaceRootResp, C, N  1994-1997.  From 1994 through 1997, specific root respiration rates for surface (0-10 cm soil depth) fine roots (< 1 mm diameter) were determined as oxygen consumption in nmol O2/g/s.  Respiration rates of excised roots were measured over a 35-min period with a gas-phase, oxygen electrode (Model LD2-2, Hansatech Ltd., Norfolk, England); all measurements were completed within 3 h of collection.  Roots were collected using three 5 cm diameter by 10 cm deep soil cores.  Samples were collected from beneath the litter layer and contained the forest floor (Oe+Oa, 1-3 cm thick) and the mineral soil to a total depth of 10 cm.  Roots were had sorted from the cores, rinsed free of adhering sol and organic material, and then analyzed for specific respiration.  Further methodological details can be found in Zogg et al. 1996 (Tree Physiology 16:719-725), Burton et al. 1996 (Canadian Journal of Forest Research 26:1761-1768) and Burton et al. 1998 (Ecological Applications 8:771-778). 

Worksheet:  RootResp, C, N by Depth 1996.  In late August 1996, specific root respiration rates at 24 deg C were deterimined at Sites A and B by soil depth (0-10, 20-30, and 40-50 cm) and root diameter class (<0.5, 0.5-1, 1-2, 2-10 mm).  Samples were collected by depth increment using four 5 cm diameter soil cores per plot, with excised roots processed and analyzed as described above for the 1994 through 1997 period.  Further methodological details can be found in Pregitzer et al. 1998 (Tree Physiology 18:665-670).  

Worksheet:  SurfaceRootResp, C, N  1998-2009  From 1998 through 2009, specific root respiration rates for surface (0-10 cm soil depth) fine roots (< 1 mm diameter) were determined as CO2 production in nmol CO2/g/s. Samples for field measurements of surface fine root respiration consisted of a bulked sample of fine roots (≤ 1 mm diameter) collected from the top 10 cm of organic matter and mineral soil at three to four locations within each plot. Roots were had sorted from the cores, rinsed free of adhering sol and organic material, and then analyzed for specific respiration.  Total root processing time was about 15 min, and samples (about 2–4 g fresh weight) were immediately placed in a respiration cuvette attached to an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA, CIRAS-I portable gas analyzer, PP Systems, Haverhill, MA). The IRGA and cuvette were configured in an open system.  Roots were maintained at field soil temperature during measurements.  Steady respiration rates were achieved within 15 min after placing a sample in the cuvette.  Further methodological details can be found in Burton et al. 2003 (Tree Physiology 23:273-280). 

Worksheet:  RootResp, C, N by Depth 2009.  In late July and early August 2009, specific root respiration rates at 18 deg C were deterimined in the field at all study sites by soil depth (0-10, 10-30, and 30-50 cm) and root diameter class (<0.5, 0.5-1, 1-2, 2-10 mm).  Samples were collected by depth increment using four 10 cm diameter soil cores per plot, with excised roots processed and analyzed as described above for the 1998 through 2009 period.  Further methodological details can be found in Burton et al. 2012 (Global Change Biology 18:258-266).

In May 1994, June 1996, September 2000, and August 2001, samples for root biomass were obtained using eight to ten soil cores (5 cm diameter, 25 cm deep) were collected from each plot at each site. Roots were sorted from the cores by hand, with live roots placed into one of five diameter classes: <0.5, 0.5-1,1-2, 2-5, and 5-10 mm. Root mass was determined after oven drying for 48 h at 70 deg C. The residual soil from one third of the cores was elutriated (Hydropneumatic Root Washer, Gillison's Variety Fabrication, Benzonia, MI, USA) to capture very fine (<0.5) roots that were missed by hand sorting. 

For the 1994 to 2001 data, RB05 is root biomass for < 0.5 mm roots, RB0510 is biomass for 0.5-10. mm roots, RB0510 is biomass for 0.5-10. mm roots, RB1020 is biomass for 1.0-2.0 mm roots, RB2050 is biomass for 2.0-5.0 mm roots, RB05100 is biomass for 5-10 mm roots, RBLT10 is biomass for all roots < 1.0 mm, RBLT20 is biomass for all roots < 2.0 mm, RBLT100 is biomass for all roots < 10.0 mm. 

In August 2004 and August 2009, samples for root biomass were obtained using three to four cores (10 cm diameter, 70 cm deep with increments from 0-10, 10-30, 30-50 and 50-70 cm) were collected from each plot at each site. Roots were sorted from the cores by hand, with live roots placed into one of five diameter classes: <0.5, 0.5-1,1-2, 2-5, and 5-10 mm. Root mass was determined after oven drying for 48 h at 70 deg C. The residual soil from one third of the cores was elutriated (Hydropneumatic Root Washer, Gillison's Variety Fabrication, Benzonia, MI, USA) to capture very fine (<0.5) roots that were missed by hand sorting. 

For the 2004 and 2009 data, depth classes are in cm below the litter layer, root diameter classes are in mm, and root biomass is in g/m2.   The 0-10 cm depth class includes roots in the forest floor (Oe and Oa layers).

ng_pub_052,Does Atmospheric NO3 Deposition Alter Actinobacterial Abundance and Community Composition in a Northern Hardwood Forest Ecosystem?,,2008,"Eisenlord, S.D.","Atmospheric nitrogen deposition can alter the cycling of carbon in forest ecosystems by slowing the microbially mediated decay of plant detritus, leading to the accumulation of organic matter in surface soil and the greater leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to ground and surface waters. However, we presently do not understand the microbial mechanisms affected by atmospheric nitrogen deposition that regulate these biogeochemical responses. Actinobacteria are one of the few groups of saprotrophic soil microorganisms which degrade lignin, uniquely producing soluble polyphenolics which can accumulate in the soil. The overall objective of this study was to examine the impact of atmospheric NO3 - deposition on actinobacterial community composition and subsequent effects on soil carbon cycling. To address this objective, actinobacterial community structure was quantified in a large-scale field study in which atmospheric NO3 - deposition has been experimentally increased for over a decade. Actinobacterial abundance was assessed using quantitative PCR of 16S rDNA and community composition was assessed though the compilation of clone libraries. Experimental atmospheric NO3 - deposition had no effect on actinobacterial relative abundance in either forest floor or surface mineral soil. However, there were significant differences in community structure and the relative occurrence of key lignin degrading actinobacteria families. Specifically, Streptomycetaceae and Micromonosporaceae, decreased in occurrence under experimental NO3 - deposition in the surface soil, whereas the occurrence of Streptomycetaceae in the forest floor increased under experimental NO3 - deposition. Changes in the actinobacterial community composition appear to be one mechanism contributing to the ecosystem-level biogeochemical changes in response to increased nitrate deposition.",Actinobacterial; Northern Hardwood Forest Ecosystem,M.S.

ng_pub_060,Plant and Microbial Mechanisms of Nitrogen Retention in Northern Hardwood Forests Receiving Atmospheric NO3 Deposition,,2006,"Eddy, W.C.","Anthropogenic N deposition in industrialized areas in Europe and North America can exceed rates of 30-55 kg N ha-1 y-1 This study examines plant and microbial mechanisms for N retention in northern hardwood forests in Michigan that have received experimental NO3- deposition at the rate of 30 kg N ha-1 y-1 for 10 years. Sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), the dominant overstory tree species in northern hardwood forests of the Lake States, has been shown to have a limited capacity to take up and assimilate NO3- (Rothstein et al. 1996). The first objective of this study is to determine if chronic NO3- addition has induced sugar maple to uptake and assimilate NO3-. The rates of NO3- and NH4+ uptake and the rate of NO3- reduction did not differ between the ambient and experimental N deposition treatments. Furthermore, the rate of NO3- uptake was much lower than the rates of NH4+ uptake, at the same time that the rates of NO3- reduction remained low. Together, these results indicate that sugar maple is not inducible as a direct sink for NO3- deposition by chronic NO3- additions. The incapacity of sugar maple to utilize NO3-, indicates that this dominant tree species cannot be a direct sink for NO3- deposition. This finding may partially explain the high rates of NO3- leaching in these forests in response to experimental NO3- deposition. Soil microbial community function can alter the capacity of an ecosystem to retain N deposition by controlling the cycling of N into stable and accumulating N pools, such as soil organic matter. The second objective of this study is to examine the in situ flow and fate of N in northern hardwood forest soils receiving experimental NO3- deposition. Microbial assimilation of added NO3- appeared to be greater in the treatment receiving only ambient N deposition.. Furthermore, net DON production was greater, and NH4+ production less, under experimental NO3- deposition. Although the results of the tracer experience indicated no difference in N retention in soil between N deposition treatments, the recovery of the tracer in more readily leached soil pools (i.e. NO3- and DON) in the chronic N deposition treatment is consistent with observations of high rates of NO3- and DON loss in this treatment (Pregitzer et al. 2004).",,M.S.

The perspective is one of an ecosystem ecologist who is primarily interested in understanding the processes important in controlling C sequestration and cycling in forest soils. From a simple mass-balance perspective, all C transferred to the soil in living or dead biomass either resides in the soil, is lost out the bottom of the ecosystem as either dissolved organic or inorganic C, or is respired back to the atmosphere in the process of soil respiration. Soil C is the largest pool of belowground C in virtually every forest ecosystem. It accrues in the mineral soil over time and resides there in different and often complex organic forms.",,Book chapter,,,,"In ""The potential of U.S. forest soils to sequester carbon and mitigate the greenhouse effect"", 2002, CRC Press, DOI: 10.1201/9781420032277-6",Text,,,,,,record,https://doi.org/10.1201/9781420032277-6,,,
