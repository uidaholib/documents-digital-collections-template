Even Utah with twice the population of Idaho has shorter legislative sessions. Thank goodness for Governor Andrus as a buffer between the State Legislators and the people. Had it not been for him last year the people on salary would really have taken it on the chin. Without a doubt the legislature would have eliminated the 50/50 which was a people's initiative. Governor Andrus told them he would Veto a recind. I believe if all highway used gasoline and diesel fuel was taxed as it should be-then a very slight increase in gasoline tax would be all that was needed. I believe you know what I mean.
