The problem is - we the people allow this to go on year after year. I have stated for many years that 30 days/year or 60 days every other year was plenty of time. Even Utah with twice the population of Idaho has shorter legislative sessions. Thank goodness for Governor Andrus as a buffer between the State Legislators and the people. Had it not been for him last year the people on salary would really have taken it on the chin. Without a doubt the legislature would have eliminated the 50/50 which was a people's initiative. Governor Andrus told them he would Veto a rescind. I believe if all highway used gasoline and diesel fuel was taxed as it should be-then a very slight increase in gasoline tax would be all that was needed. I believe you know what I mean. Keep up the good work and maybe the legislators will attempt to do better. All we ask is for fairness to all the people.
