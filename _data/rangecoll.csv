An Analysis of Public Rangeland Policies in the United States,"This 1970s-era study is based on work conducted for the Public Land Law Review Commission in 1968/69. It continues an attempt to investigate public rangeland policies in order to 1) ascertain the objectives, past and present of these policies, 2) evaluate the policies as to the degree that attainment of the objectives was possible, 3) evaluate the extent to which the objectives were attained, 4) assess the relevance of the original objectives to current issues in land policy, and 5) identify emerging issues and to evaluate them in the light of older objectives and future needs. There is an attempt to update (to the 1970s) statistics regarding land use, rangeland economics and agronomy, and ecosystem management.",,1970,public policy;  public land review;  grazing policy;  Rangeland Management;  rangeland;  Grazing,University of Idaho,Rimbey_2017,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.
