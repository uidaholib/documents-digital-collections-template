A typology is developed that breaks down site attributes into three categories: necessity attributes (those that are necessary for providing a minimum quality camping experience), experience attributes (those that relate most closely with the preferred experience outcomes desired by recreationists), and amenity attributes (those that are least important to overall campsite choice, but may help in making the final decision).

Questions addressed boater characteristics, trip characteristics, preferences for river flows, conditions encountered and experience quality, and opinions about management. On 47 days between late February and early August 2002, 426 private whitewater boaters using the 13-mile stretch of the Clackamas River completed on-site questionnaires. Results indicate the majority of boaters are kayakers, males, living within 50 miles of the river, and are experienced boaters. Use levels have increased to the point that most boaters feel at least slightly crowded, and a substantial number have altered their use of the river to cope with crowding. Nevertheless, few believe that boating should be limited. Other conditions are relatively minor problems, with the exception of vandalism to private property and human waste along the river.

J.",1981,Conference Proceedings,application/pdf,mccool_utter_1981.pdf,"This paper proposes a structure and process for developing allocation systems in river recreation settings. Middle Fork Salmon River users were asked to rank and rate allocation systems, evaluation criteria, and rationing techniques. A workshop of 25 individuals spanning the spectrum of river recreation interests was used to develop and narrow down criteria and techniques. A mail questionnaire was then developed and sent to 1451 river users from three user groups: outfitters, nonoutfitters, and individuals rejected in the lottery. Survey results indicate even pool and the current Middle Fork system are the most acceptable rationing techniques. The most acceptable allocation systems were split by the groups favoring their own experiences on the river: outfitters favored reservation systems, nonoutfitters and lottery rejectees favored lottery systems.

Three variables were hypothesized to be a function of a users willingness to try: perceived chance of success of obtaining a permit, perceived fairness of the system, and acceptability of the system. A path model of these variables was developed and tested using five allocation systems: pricing, reservation, lottery, queuing, and merit. Researchers also tested consistency of user evaluations across the five allocation systems. Results indicate users view allocation systems similarly when evaluating their willingness to try the system. Results also suggest that chance of success is a large factor in a users determination to try a system and their acceptability of a system.
