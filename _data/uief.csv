A sample terminal session, using existing data files, is described in detail. The second manuscript quantifies the losses incurred in this study and the results of logger training upon reducing these losses. The University of Idaho’s Experimental Forest Logging Crew was studied and losses associated with felling and bucking errors “before training” and “after training” are presented. The third manuscript describes study design and sampling procedures used in this study.

However, soil compaction occurring from mechanized harvesting operations often remains for many years and may contribute to a decline in long-term site productivity. A controlled experiment on a silt loam soil was conducted to determine (a) the effectiveness of logging slash to buffer compaction, (b) the influence of the number of machine passes, and (c) the contribution of soil moisture to changes in penetration resistance during a cut-to-length harvest in northern Idaho. Penetration resistance was measured at three soil depths (10, 20, and 30 cm) for three different moisture contents (low, medium, and high) and slash amounts (none, light, and heavy) after each of 12 machine passes (one pass each with a harvester and an empty forwarder, and 10 passes with a fully-loaded forwarder). At all three soil depths the main effect of moisture content and machine passes on penetration resistance was significant, but slash amounts alone did not significantly affect penetration resistance. After 12 passes, we measured the greatest penetration resistance in the medium soil moisture treatment at 5 to15 cm of soil depth. When evaluated at similar moisture contents after harvesting, the soil that was driest during machine traffic (low moisture treatment) had the lowest penetration resistance. Slash was important for protecting the soil against compaction in the medium and high soil moisture treatments. Penetration resistance did not significantly increase after the second pass of a fully loaded forwarder (31,752 kg) at any moisture content or slash level.

This interest is due to the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of using small harvesters in the harvest of small diameter trees. This paper presents research regarding the productivity of a Neuson 11002 HV harvester in a clearcut with reserves and a thinning treatment of Douglas-fir tussock moth damaged stand, as well the investigation of the influence of tree branch characteristics upon harvester productivity. Tree heights, diameter at breast height (DBH), species, branch size and branch interval data were collected, to investigate the effect of these characteristics on productivity. An elemental time study was conducted using video footage of harvest operations to determine machine productivity. Production costs are estimated at $5.54/m3 in the clearcut, and $6.22/m3 for the thinning, on a scheduled machine hour and mean tree volume basis. Statistical analysis revealed that brush density, machine travel distance, tree DBH and branch size are influential upon tree harvest time in thinning. Branch size and branch interval are influential upon tree processing time, with branch size of high statistical significance.

Several modifications were necessary to adapt the machine to a timber harvesting situation. The major modifications included design and fabrication of skid plates, grapple boom assembly brackets, grapple, operator and machine safety canopies, and rerouting hydraulic hoses. Cost analyses were made for two cases: (1) skidding thinned material directly to the landing with the small skidder and (2) prebunching thinned material to a main skid trail with the small skidder and moving the material to the landing with either a grapple or choker skidder. These cases were defined in terms of length of skidding distance to the landing. For shorter skidding distances, skidding costs were $177.27 per acre for direct skidding, $144.82 per acre for prebunching and subsequent transport with a grapple skidder, and $214.96 per acre for prebunching and subsequent transport with a choker skidder. For longer skidding distance, skidding costs were $216.66 per acre for direct skidding, $151.64 per acre for prebunching and subsequent transport with a grapple skidder, and $229.47 per acre for prebunching and subsequent transport with a choker skidder. The most important variables affecting turn time in the regression equations included skidding distance on primary and secondary skid trails, and trees and logs skidded per turn. Soil disturbance caused by the small skidder was evaluated in terms of soil compaction and aerial soil surface disturbance. Soil bulk density samples taken during a controlled experiment with soil moisture contents varying from 20.38 to 25.32 percent (%) indicated that soil compaction was limited to within six inches of the soil surface. Soil bulk density samples taken from the most heavily traveled skid trail on the test plot indicated that soil compaction was limited to within the top two inches of the soil surface. The results of the aerial soil surface disturbance study indicated that only 13% of the area was disturbed to a point where erosion could occur as a result of exposed mineral soil. Residual stand damage was evaluated in terms of percent damager by diameter class to the trees of the residual stand. Sapling-sized trees (31.98%) were damaged more heavily than pole-sized trees (17.545%). Use of a herringbone falling pattern helped keep stand damage within acceptable limits. The results of the study showed that a more durable machine is needed in these types of timber harvesting operations.",Flat Creek; West Hatter Creek; soil disturbance; soil compaction; small skidder; grapple skidder; chokers; cost analysis; small diameter trees; thinning operations; logging residue; forest operations,Flat Creek; West Hatter Creek,UIEF; Flat Creek; West Hatter Creek,46.851013,-116.724478,,,,,,Department of Forest Products,,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/2vsn7u/alma9926730701851,SD388.L4,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0017.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0017.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0017_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0017_th.jpg

Two types of skidding operations were observed. A conventional single piece skidding method were compared to those required in pre-bunching system, where the logs were felled, bucked and pre-bunched during the felling activities by the sawyer. Evaluation of the system productivity through detailed time and production studies led to the development of predictive models of the work cycle elements. A higher piece rate production is obtained by skidding in bundles than with the conventional skidding method. No gains in volume per load were observed using either method, however, greater utilization and more product recovery was observed using the pre-bunching method. Under case study conditions of equal piece size the skidding cost is more sensitive to skidding distance in conventional skidding than skidding pre-bunched material. For total thinning costs under equal piece size conditions there was no break-even point between skidding methods. The pre-bunching skidding method had a lower cost for all distances analyzed.

This thesis draws on the results of two previous small-log skidder projects: a computer simulation model and testing of the original mini-skidder design. The project continues with the testing and analysis of an improved design. A 43-hp backhoe power unit was obtained and converted for skidding use. Modifications included the addition of skidpans, a safety canopy, and a small hydraulic grapple mounted on the backhoe boom. Time/motion studies of this machine in three different stands were conducted. Evaluations of soil-compaction, soil disturbance, and residual damage were also performed. Production ranged from 47.6 cubic feet per hour to 201.6 cubic feet per hour. An improvement in the grapple design led to a significant increase in hourly piece production. Delay time was reduced during the project and machine availability in the last stand was 72.2% with a static ground pressure of 9 psi, the mini-skidder caused small, but statistically significant, increases in bulk density of the upper 6 inches of the skid trails. Areal soil disturbance of the stands was limited. An average of 80% of total stand area was classified as slightly disturbed. Damage to the residual stand from skidding operations occurred on 16.5% of the residual trees. Data from the field testing were used to develop regression equations for predicting turn-time. This project shows the feasibility of using a small machine to skid thinning residues. Skidding costs were approximately $200.00 per acre. A gross profit of 110% was realized in one stand by utilizing the recovered material for post and rail products. The general simulation model developed in an earlier small-log skidder project was revised to specifically model the improved skidder design.

It consists of 1,300 acres of mature forest. This unit has neither a tactical nor an operational plan to provide direction for management and use of the land, including education, research, production and public use. Since 1952, there has been no grazing or fire activities and no other forms of active management of vegetation. This research paper specially focuses on the development of an environmental assessment for the East Hatter Creek watershed comprising 3,000 acres including the 1,300 acres of the East Hatter Creek Unit of the Experimental Forest. It consists of a no action and three forest management alternatives including the proposed action. The main objective is to combine the joint production of timber and white-tailed deer winter range while sustaining and enhancing water quality, riparian areas, wildlife, and aesthetic values. This paper was a compilation of the exercise class work made by students of the Integrated Natural Resources Planning class during spring of 1996, and the results are based on public opinion.

This interest is due to the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of using small harvesters in the harvest of small-diameter trees. This paper presents research regarding the productivity of a Neuson 11002 HV harvester in a clearcut with reserves and a thinning treatment of Douglas-fir tussock moth damaged stand, as well the investigation of the influence of tree branch characteristics upon harvester productivity. Tree heights, diameter at breast height (DBH), species, branch size and branch interval data were collected, to investigate the effect of these characteristics on productivity. An elemental time study was conducted using video footage of harvest operations to determine machine productivity. Production costs are estimated at $5.54/m3 in the clearcut, and $6.22/m3 for the thinning, on a scheduled machine hour and mean tree volume basis. Statistical analysis revealed that brush density, machine travel distance, tree DBH and branch size are influential upon tree harvest time in thinning. Branch size and branch interval are influential upon tree processing time, with branch size of high statistical significance.

Residue processing was tested with a wood shear – firewood processor. The shear used a hydraulically operated knife to chop residue pieces into firewood lengths. A hydraulic loader fed the shear. Although the shear was tested on gentle terrain the operation would work well in steep terrain because of the linear arrangement of equipment. Results of the two field studies were used to simulate combined operations of the yarder and shear in various operating modes that included operation of the shear and loader at the yarder location. Results indicate that the yarder can effectively remove sawlog and residue pieces concurrently. The yarder productive turn was not influenced by the residue pieces in turn. Imbalanced production between the yarder and skidder did, however, create delays at the yarder because the yarder waited for the skidder to clear the yarder landing deck. Skidder production was directly impacted by residue recovery with the extra time spent piling residue pieces and maneuvering at the landing.

In addition, an evaluation of standing trees using stress wave based NDT methods was conducted to predict the quality of products produced from them. These studies explored the correlation between a tap tone NDT technique, static bending test, stress wave test, and flexural vibration test that are commonly applied in wood. A strong relationship was found between the tap tone technique and the other techniques. Also, studying the effects of growth characteristics of wood on stress wave propagation through lumber, we demonstrated that stress wave velocities are significantly affected by the growth characteristics of wood. A quality index model, using stress wave velocity measurements, for predicting the quality of products produced from standing trees was also developed in this study. The modulus of elasticity (MOE) of lumber was positively correlated with the quality index of the tree from which lumber was produced.

Differences in seedbed characteristics were statistically analyzed to determine sources of germination and establishment variability. Burning altered the natural organic matter seedbeds. Burning removed the topmost duff layer and increased the seedbed bulk density. Bulk density increased as duff depth decreased on burned seedbeds. Moisture availability and thermal characteristics of these seedbeds were improved. Germination was greater on mineral soil seedbeds and burned seedbeds. Seed germination on burned seedbeds was correlated with duff depth and bulk density. As duff depth decreased and bulk density increased on burned seedbeds, germination increased. Improved thermal properties and moisture availability of burned seedbeds help explain germination variability. Seedling establishment was a function of the number of seeds germinating.

uief_0030,Carbon Refixation in Photosynthetic Bark of Western White Pine Branches,"Cernusak, Lucas A.",1999-12,Thesis,"I conducted a methodological experiment related to measuring gas exchange in woody tissues using removable cuvettes. The question addressed was whether the volume of respiring tissues should be measured between the midpoints of gaskets used to attach the cuvettes to tissue sections, or between the gasket interior edges. The simple experiment suggested that the gasket midpoints were the correct position for determining the tissue volume actually contributing to a respiration measurement. I investigated the functional controls over light-dependent refixation of respired CO2 in photosynthetic bark of western white pine (Pinus monticola Dougl. Ex D. Don) branches. Gross photosynthesis increased with increasing intensity of photo synthetically active radiation (PAR) to >2000µmol m-2 s -1 and with increasing bark surface temperature from 15 to >45˚ C. Maximum observed refixation rates were 76±3% (mean ± SE) of dark respiration. At a given temperature and irradiance, dark respiration rate was the physiological parameter that correlated most strongly with gross photosynthesis (R=0.89, p<0.0001, n=43). Dark respiration rates varied 20-fold among branches. Over this range, refixation averaged 55±2% of dark respiration at 25˚C and 1000 µmol PAR m-2 s -1. However, refixation was not correlated with internal CO2 concentrations in illuminated branches; these concentrations remained fairly constant. Specific bark area, bark conductance to water vapor, bark chlorophyll a/b ratio, and bark nitrogen concentration varied pronouncedly with canopy depth in mature trees. Results are summarized in a simple model of refixation driven by light, temperature, and dark respiration rate.",Flat Creek; western white pine; pinus monticola; carbon refixation; gas exchange; forest ecology,Flat Creek,UIEF; Flat Creek,46.851013,-116.724478,,,,,,Department of Forest Resources,,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/2vsn7u/alma9958676401851,QK882.C47 1999,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0030.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0030.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0030_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0030_th.jpg

It also has good potential for livestock grazing, and many of the member shrubs are important big game browse species. Little, however, is known regarding success ional relationships of vegetative composition. Descriptions were made of some of the seral communities in this habitat type and an ordination of these same communities was also made to develop a secondary success ional sequence. Stands undisturbed since 1900 have vegetative compositions which generally parallel published records of climax Douglas fir/ Physocarpus communities. Burning produced high cover of Ceanothus sanguineus and Spiraea betulifolia, while logging produced high cover of Holodiscus discolor and Rosa gymnocarpa. Rosa nutkane is the only shrub with highest cover on grazed sites. In the herbaceous layer, Calamagrostis rubescens has high cover on burned sites while Arnica cordifolia has high cover on logged sites. Species composition in the herbaceous layer of grazed sites shows the most deissimilarity to other sites. The ordination produced results which, when graphed, form a cone or pyramid-like model of succession. Highly disturbed sites form the base and climax sites form the apex. The time required to reach climax is related to degree or intensity of disturbance. Disturbance intensity is the most important factor affecting succession.

Additionally , two rodent barriers, plastic sheltercones and Vexar mesh cones, were tested for their effects on seed germination, seedling survival, and seedling height growth. Encapsulating the seed caused significantly improved germination of seed for both species in the first field study, and for ponderosa pine in the second field study. Significant improvements in germination were obtained when barriers were used, thus indicating some seed protection from rodents and birds. However, seedlings inside sheltercones had a significantly higher rate of mortality than those under the Vexar cones or with no protection treatments. The cause was determined to be partially due to increased temperatures inside the sheltercones. Temperature inside the sheltercones approached lethal levels during the hottest part of the summer day.

uief_0035,Diameter Growth in Western White Pine,"Eikum, Robert L.",1944,Thesis,"A study was made of the diameter growth characteristics of western white pine in North Idaho based upon analyses of stumps and increment cores from five recently logged areas. Western white pine was found to grow in diameter inside bark at breast height at surprisingly uniform rates. In dominant trees the rate of diameter growth decreased only slightly with increased age and diameter. For all trees, most of which were old growth, the mean growth rate was very uniform to 24 inches D.B.H and at the rate of one inch in diameter inside bark each seven or eight years. Therefore the rate was slower and at slightly decreasing rate. Above 24 inches diameter increased at the rate of one inch in ten years to one inch in twelve years at diameters between forty and forty-eight inches inside bark. The mean number of rings per inch of radius varied among the different areas from 13.14 to 18.82, the coefficient of variation being in the general range of 33 per cent. The mean number of rings per inch of radius for all trees was 15.11, the standard deviation of the values making up the sample 6.55 and the standard deviation of the mean .21. the median value was 13 rings per inch and the modal value 11 rings per inch. Analyses of growth patterns of individual trees indicated that the growth rate of western white pine was controlled largely by growing conditions and degree of dominance. Senescence apparently was not an important factor. Diameter growth rate was found to decelerate rapidly in co dominant trees from a very heavily stocked even-aged stand in the one-hundred year age class. A few dominants only were able to maintain rapid, uniform rates of diameter increase. Old growth stands of western white pine tend to be uneven-aged due perhaps to light fires or to other factors which might create small openings in the stand. Western pine will become established under partial suppression permitting a diameter growth rate of one inch in radius inside bark in approximately twenty-five years. It is capable of undergoing long periods of relative suppression, up to one hundred years or more on the basis of evidence obtained. It is capable also of responding to favorable growing conditions even at all ages of three hundred years. Periods of rapid growth or of suppression during early life did not appear to influence the later growth of western white pine trees.",Flat Creek; western white pine; pinus monticola; growth pattern; diameter growth; silviculture,Flat Creek,UIEF; Flat Creek,46.851013,-116.724478,,,,,,School of Forestry,,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/2vsn7u/alma9965627301851,Spec Col MG5689,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0035.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0035.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0035_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0035_th.jpg

Fifty-two ponderosa pine and twenty Douglas-fir saplings were identified and studied under a range of light conditions from sun to shade. For ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir, maximum stomatal conductance was found to decline with increasing shade. Leaf specific conductivity, predrawn water potential, and productivity, measured as three-year height and basal area increment, also significantly declined with increasing shade for ponderosa pine. Predrawn water potential and leaf specific conductivity were also strongly related to stomatal conductance, as expected in terms of water supply and demand. Productivity was positively related to leaf specific conductivity and negatively related to shade for both species. Leaf specific conductivity is a measure of the hydraulic sufficiency of a tree to supply water to transpiring foliage, so it follows that trees with a low leaf specific conductivity are less able to maintain stomatal conductance and transpiration with a given pressure gradient. Thus, they have reduced carbon assimilation and lower productivity as a result. The quantification of productivity can be directly related to the level of shade for practical forest management.",West Hatter Creek; stomatal conductance; shade; competition; watershed management; specific conductivity; carbon assimilation; productivity; ponderosa pine; pinus ponderosa; silviculture,West Hatter Creek,UIEF; West Hatter Creek,46.83765,-116.824734,,,,,,Department of Forest Resources,,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/2vsn7u/alma9961581701851,SD358.8.I2E88 2001,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0036.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0036.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0036_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0036_th.jpg
uief_0037,Response of Ponderosa Pine to Controlled-Release Fertilizers,"Fan, Zhaofei",1999-07,Thesis,"Prior to sowing seeds, three controlled-release fertilizers (fast release (FR), moderate release (MR) and slow release (SR)) were incorporated into the growing media at rates of 0.8, 1.6 or 3.2 grams per seedling as supplements to nursery supplied soluble fertilizer. Effects on seedling caliper and height growth, biomass allocation, nutrient status and root growth potential of the ""160190"" container ponderosa pine (Pinusponderosa Doug. ex Laws) both in the greenhouse and after planting were evaluated. At lifting (December 1 of 1996), the caliper, height and total dry weight of fertilized seedlings ranged from 3.2 to 3.6 mrn, 15.8 to 17.9 cm and 2.6 to 3.9 grams, respectively, compared to the 2.8 mm, 14.8 cm and 2.0 grams of unfertilized seedlings. The 3.2 grams of MR or SR fertilizer treatments produced foliar N, Mg, B, Fe and Cu deficiency patterns and decreased ponderosa pine seedling root growth potential. Two years after planting, fertilization significantly increased seedling caliper, height, total and component biomass, but did not change component dry weight ratios and shoot/root ratios. The 3.2 grams of MR or SR fertilizer treatments produced significantly higher mortality (55 and 36 % respectively) than the controls. The mortality was strongly correlated with root growth potential. The best dosage for caliper and height growth was 2.0 and 1.9 grams per seedling for FR fertilizer, 1.8 and 2.0 grams per seedling for MR fertilizer and 1.8 and 2.1 grams per seeding for SR fertilizer, respectively. In another experiment, four controlled-release fertilizers (fast release (FR), moderate release (MR), slow release (SR) and slow-release with micro-nutrient extended (ME)) were applied at rates of 5, 15 and 30 grams per seedling respectively, into a hole 6 inches deep and 3 inches apart from the planting point of the ""160190"" ponderosa pine seedlings on the up-hill side immediately after planting.

One seedtree and seven shelterwood cuts were examined and compared with potential plantations on the same sites. Growth and development of natural and artificially regenerated stands were projected using the Prognosis Model for Stand Development. Biological yields were evaluated economically with the Net Present Value (NPV) criterion. The success of natural regeneration was highly dependent upon the habitat type, overwood and regeneration characteristics, and the economic assumptions used in the analysis. For the natural stands on the Thuja/Pachistima habitat type, results showed preferred reforestation method was clearcut and plant to western white pine to maximize NPV. On the Abies/Pachistma habitat type natural regeneration was financially more attractive. Of the five natural stands on this habitat type, four had approximately equal NPV’s to comparable ponderosa pine plantations. Within this habitat type, several tree/stand attributes were desirable for successful natural regeneration. Overwood density, growth, and species composition had a major impact on the overall NPV of the natural stands. Empirical models were developed to quantify desirable overwood characteristics. Variables with proved significant in the models were tree diameter, crown ratio, and competitive status. Similarly, the composition, the amount, and growth of the regeneration had the most significant impact on the overall NPV of the natural stands for a given set of economic conditions. The financial results reported in this study were greatly influenced by the economic assumptions used in the analysis. Financial success of natural regeneration was highly sensitive to the discount rate. Varying stumpage prices influenced the magnitude of NPV but did not change the preferred regime.",Flat Creek; natural regeneration; artificial regeneration; economic analysis; shelterwood; seedtree; silviculture,Flat Creek,UIEF; Flat Creek,46.851013,-116.724478,,,,,,Department of Forest Resources,,,SD409.F58,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0038.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0038.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0038_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0038_th.jpg

Most beetles attracted to host pine volatiles in an arena olfactometer were desiccated males with air in their ventriculus, both of these conditions resulting from post-emergence activity, particularly flying. Most beetles attracted to male pheromone in the presence of host volatiles were desiccated, sexually mature females with air in their ventriculus and visibly fewer fat bodies than beetles that were not attracted. Factors not significantly related to host or pheromone were beetle size, abundance of phoretic mites and parasitic nematodes, and ambient barometric pressure. First-generation beetles reared in slash were more genetically heterozygous than second generation beetles reared in standing trees. Second generation beetles were more heterozygous after overwintering, presumably a result of selective mortality of poorly adapted, homozygous individuals. This study indicates that stressful conditions favor biologically fit, heterozygous individuals, and that a range of response to host and pheromone, controlled by physiological factors, enables beetles to exploit nearby and distant susceptible hosts, enhancing both survival and outcrossing among other populations.",Moscow Mountain; ips pini; pine engraver; pheromones; host odor; pheromone attraction; genetic diversity; ponderosa pine; pinus ponderosa; entomology,,Moscow Mountain,,,,,,,,Department of Forest Resources,,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/2vsn7u/alma9941160001851,QL596.S35G3 1987,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0039.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0039.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0039_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0039_th.jpg

The specific cause for canker inactivation was not investigated, but major factors that influenced inactivation were evaluated in the hope that this information may provide an aid to the management decision process.
Cankers become inactive because supporting branches died. Bole cankers rarely became inactive and control strategies should therefore be applied to branch cankers. Rodents, insects, and secondary fungi may have a larger effect on inactivation than the death of the supportive tissue.

Pre-plant and post-plant applications of the liquid (Velpar L) and granular (Pronone 10G) formulations of hexazinone applied both as a spot and broadcast treatments were evaluated. Hexazinone was effective in controlling competing herbaceous vegetation on forest sites and thus improved the growth and vigor of conifer regeneration.

uief_0043,"Estimating the Pre-European Settlement Occurrence of Ponderosa Pine in Latah County, Idaho","Johnson, Mara Patrice",1999-12,Thesis,"Over the past century, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests have declined in distribution throughout their range and now occur primarily in dense stands with smaller trees (Covington and Moore 1994). Some researchers believe the window of opportunity for rectifying these unhealthy conditions through ecological restoration is fairly small, perhaps 15 to30 years (Covington et al. 1994). Noss et al. (1995) considers pre-European settlement conditions as a reasonable goal for restoration because this predates extensive manipulation and degradation of many forests in the West. The primary objective of this study was to quantify and map historic occurrence of ponderosa pine for Latah County in northern Idaho by correlating occurrence of ponderosa pine in the original General Land Office (GLO) survey records to biophysical variables. A regression model was used to estimate pre-settlement ponderosa pine distribution. The secondary objective was to compare the estimated pre-settlement ponderosa pine to the current distribution and show any changes. The model used in this study estimates pre-settlement ponderosa pine forests occurred over 887,362,200 m2 of Latah County. The current land cover classification shows 101,074,500m2 of ponderosa pine forests now exists, a loss of 89 percent. This study suggests the largest amount of pre-settlement ponderosa pine forests has been replaced by agriculture. Agricultural lands have replaced about 426,569,400 m2 of ponderosas pine forests in the study area. In addition, 61,515,900 m2 of estimated pre-settlement mixed xeric forest is now agricultural land. Next to agriculture, pre-settlement ponderosa pine forests have been predominantly replaced by foothills grassland (197,369,100 m2 ), warm mesic shrubland (75,053,700 m2 ), mixed xeric forest (30,573,000 m2 ), mixed mesic forest (24,843,600 m2 ), and Douglas-fir forests (17,659,800 m2 ). This study shows using geographical information systems (GIS) allows large areas to effectively be assessed fairly rapidly. It also shows that using GLO original survey records to estimate pre-European settlement in the West may provide some of the best information on relatively unimpacted forests.

Hence, there is a real need for stream-corridor restoration projects and techniques for formulating and evaluation alternative restoration strategies. The paper presents a straightforward decision model for stream corridor restoration that employs a goal-based methodology and a multi-criteria technique, utility analysis, as aids in decision making. Utility analysis allows consideration of ecological, socioeconomic, and recreational goals, without monetary valuation, using a subjective weighting system. The Rosgen Stream Classification system is used for estimating changes in stream condition from the current condition to the desired future, or restored condition. The importance of the decision model as an aid to, rather than a replacement for, professional judgment, is highlighted.

Such research methodology can also be applied to other tree species and wildlife. Available environmentally map able factors for ponderosa pine were mapped using the GIS system ARC/INFO. Different factors were rated according to the scientific literature. Overlaying, which is essentially the operation of putting single feature map layers one on another was performed. A comparison between the Experimental Forest manager’s decision about the introduction of the ponderosa pine in the study area and the results gotten from the GIS analysis, using the linear combination method, shows that only 33.33% of the study results are correct. To improve on this performance, one should work with very precise ecological data, avoid elimination of small polygons on the output map and include a sufficient number of ecological factors in the study.

The site of operations was an area of cut-over white pine forest included within a part of the University of Idaho Experimental Forest in Latah County, Idaho. A typical wintering area was sampled to study the relative efficiency of plots for sampling yields of winter deer browse. It was an upland Douglas fir type on which snowberry, baldhip rose and serviceberry produced approximately 92% of the forage. The current annual twig growth of browse species was harvested from twelve large plots. Six of the major plots were located within a block 288 feet wide and 396 feet long and the other six were located within a block of the same size. A major plot was six feet wide and forty-eight feet long and was divided in such a way that it contained six one by eight foot subplots, six two by eight foot subplots, and six three by eight foot subplots. The forage weights were separated by species and comparisons made with a density estimate method of determining relative abundance. Browse between the ground level and a height of six feet was harvested but the first one foot level was collected separately. To study winter use of browse 128 utilization transects were distributed in both the Douglas fir and arborvitae zones. A transect consisted of a line, fifty feet in length, along which browse plants were tagged and measured. The current annual twig growth was measured in inches before the winter browsing season began. Plants were re measured the following spring to determine the amount of browsing. The crown intercept of browse species was recorded for each transect to the nearest one-tenth of one foot. Snow trailing was employed as a check against the twig measurement method of utilization determination. Deer trails were followed in the snow and counts were made of freshly browsed twigs.",browse; deer; Flat Creek; browse utilization; winter browse; silviculture,Flat Creek,UIEF; Flat Creek,46.851013,-116.724478,,,,,,Department of Forest Resources,,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/2vsn7u/alma9937356201851,QL737.U55M75,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0055.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0055.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0055_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0055_th.jpg

The initial stand structure and growth dynamics were investigated and a forest value criterion was used for the economic analysis. For successful conversion of stands to managed unevenaged conditions, neither all aged conditions nor a close approximation of a balanced “ideal” diameter distribution was a necessary condition. The simulated volume growth during a 100 year period was higher under the selection management alternative rather than in the evenage alternatives. The forest values between the best evenaged and selection management regimes differed little. A low initial stand value, together with a potential for high value increment was a favorable condition for the conversion to selection management. The choice of the conversion strategy has a high impact on the forest value.

uief_0057,Harvesting Intensity Effects on Site Characteristics of the Western Redcedar/Queen Cup Beadlily Habitat Type in Northern Idaho: A Second Evaluation of the Adaptive Forestry Approach,"Murphy, Blake O.",1999-10,Thesis,"Two studies were conducted on the University of Idaho Experimental Forest to evaluate the effects of adaptive forestry methods on site characteristics that influence site productivity. Adaptive forestry is a forest management philosophy that addresses scientific and social concerns about logging, especially in old growth forests, while maintaining employment opportunities and production of forest products that society demands. The first study was implemented during 1991 and 1992 (AF92) and collected pre- and post-harvest measurements on overstory and understory vegetation, downed woody debris (DWD), forest floor and fuel depths, soil strength, and soil pH. In 1998 and 1999, the second study (AF98) re-measured these characteristics. Additional data collected and analyzed in AF98 included total soil nitrogen, mineralizable nitrogen, and soil organic matter. Data analyses were conducted with one way analysis of variance (ANOVA). One-sided P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Four treatment units with similar aspect and elevation were established in the Thuja plicata/clintonia uniflora habitat type: an undisturbed control, a traditional clearcut, an adaptive forestry free thinning, and an adaptive forestry seed-tree cut. After harvests, the regenerative treatments (i.e. seed-tree and clearcut units) were burned under prescription and planted with container-grown conifer seedlings. Tree regeneration and survival was higher in the seed-tree unit (1,500 trees per acre(tpa)) than in the clearcut (120 tpa). Understory vegetation was 78%, 60%, 31%, and 2% for the clearcut, seed-tree, thinning, and control, respectively. Forest floor depth was significantly different between treatments. Significant increases in pH were observed in the forest floor of the clearcut and seed-tree units. No significant differences were observed between treatments for total nitrogen and quantity of organic matter. Significantly less mineralizable nitrogen was present in the forest floor and top 10cm of mineral soil in all harvested units when compared to the control. Mineralizable nitrogen in the forest floor was reduced in the clearcut, seed-tree, and thinning by 32%, 33%, and 33%, respectively. Mineralizable nitrogen in the top 10cm of mineral soil was reduced in the clearcut, seed-tree, and thinning by 30%, 24%, and 25%. Mineralizable nitrogen was not significantly different between treatments in the mineral soil at 10-30cm depth. Significant differences in soil strength were observed at 5cm and 10cm depths. At the 5cm depth, increases over control levels were 6.6%, 3.1%, 1.7% for the clearcut, seed-tree, and thinning units, respectively. At the 10cm depth, increases over control levels were 10.4%, 3.3%, and 2.9% for the clearcut, seed-tree, and thinning units. Of the characteristics examined, mineralizable nitrogen and soil strength are the most probably sources of reduced long-term productivity. Adaptive forestry practices reduced harvesting impacts on soil strength, but mineralizable nitrogen was similarly altered in both adaptive forestry and traditional clearcut units. Continued assessment of these site characteristics at 5-year intervals will assist in determining amelioration rates and provide further insight into the benefits and shortcomings of adaptive forestry practices.",Big Meadow Creek; western redcedar; queen cup beadlily; adaptive forest management; adaptive management; adaptive forest management; harvesting intensity; silviculture,Big Meadow Creek,UIEF; Big Meadow Creek,46.799488,-116.812869,"NE 1/4 S22, NW 1/4 S23",T40N,R4W,,,Department of Forest Resources,,,SD538.2.I2M87,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0057.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0057.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0057_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0057_th.jpg

We measured small scale micro site heterogeneity in an Abies grandis/Physocarpus malvaceus habitat type in northern Idaho. Micro sites were classified on October 1987 with three locator (site, line, sampling point) and eight descriptor (duff depth, litter cover, stick number, vegetative shading, soil surface roughness, presence of vegetation and moss) categorical variables. A burning treatment was applied to half of the sampling points. Classification of micro site types (distinct combinations of descriptor variables) was performed prior to treatment, following treatment, and one year after treatment (1988). Variation was investigated using principle component analysis (PCA) and chi-square analysis. Burning reduced micro site variability, especially single-occurring micro site types, but the reduction was short lived. The micro site type most common in all three measurements (<5 cm duff depth, 21-50% litter cover, 0 sticks, moss, shading, vegetation) was reduced in frequency of occurrence with burning. Locator variables accounted for 98% of the variation. If locator vegetation were the primary descriptors accounting for 73-84% of the micro site type variation. Western larch (Larix occidentalis) seeds were distributed after burning treatment (seven on each sample point), and the germinations (radicle emerging from seed), germinants (radicle entering forest floor and needles developing) and seedling (seed cap off and needles visible) numbers tracked over two growing seasons. Germinations (741) and germinants (656) from 17,500 seeds were found on a wide variety of micro site types for representing “safe sites” (the zone with the characteristics for germination and seedling development to occur) for these stages of development. Safe site requirements became more specific as the seedling developed, with 47 seedling surviving on 33 micro sites types at the end of the first growing season. Significant descriptor variables and interactions were identified from regression; analysis produces high (R2 = 0.75) predictability at the end of the first growing season for initial seedling establishment. Safe factors not measured in this study are critical for germination of western larch. The effects of shading, burning and mechanical seedbed treatment on western larch germination and first year establishment were also assessed. Sixteen 0.74 m2 -plots were established in 1987 and 1988 and 150 western larch seeds (100 expected to germinate) distributed of randomly applied seedbed treatments (burning or mechanical, mineral soil or duff, shaded or non-shaded, caged or non-caged to protect from predation). Germination was significantly greater on caged units than on uncaged units by mid-season due to seed predation on uncaged units. Shading was not a significant factor. Mortality of seedlings, most likely caused by a dry period with high temperatures from July to mid-August, resulted in no significant differences in seedling numbers between seedbed treatments by mid-August.",soils; microsite; microclimate; heterogeneity; species richness; community diversity; grand fir; abies grandis; ninebark; silviculture,UIEF,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,,Department of Forest Resources,,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_proquest_journals_304007259,SD144.I2079 1992,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0058.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0058.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0058_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0058_th.jpg

As planting costs average $247.00 per hectare, an efficient and economical means of establishing regeneration has been sought. Seed wafers may offer an alternative in reforestation by providing the seed with a compact microenvironment favorable for germination. A seed wafer is composed of a seed embedded in a tablet of a fine grade of vermiculite and activated carbon bound by methylcellulose. Germination values of the four best wafer treatments of ponderosa pine were not significantly different from the germination value of the untreated control seeds. Untreated Douglas-fir seed germinated faster and more completely than controls. Field plantings of seed wafers and controls failed largely due to an atypically dry spring and summer. Greenhouse studies revealed that the water-holding capacity of vermiculite facilitated the imbibitions of water. It does not seem likely that the wafer material surrounding the seed inhibits the exchange of gases prior to germination. The methylcellulose-bound wafers break apart readily in water and provide a porous medium surrounding the seed",seed wafers; regeneration; Flat Creek; silviculture,Flat Creek,UIEF; Flat Creek,46.839291,-116.739612,S5,T40N,R3W,,,Department of Forest Resources,,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/2vsn7u/alma9927414101851,SD409.P6,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0061.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0061.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0061_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0061_th.jpg

Prescribed burning may be beneficial in managing uneven-aged ponderosa pine stands, but variability in fuels within these stands often makes fire behavior and fire effects difficult to predict. I sampled three uneven-aged ponderosa stands in northern Idaho, and constructed site-specific custom fuel models to describe litter, herbaceous, shrub, and downed woody fuels at 72 sample points, and predicted fire behavior at each sample poin. Of the 72 samples, 19 produced high rates of spread, heat per unit area, and greater than 20% predicted mortality in trees with a 5-in diameter at breast height (DBH). Using cluster analysis, I classified these 19 fuel models into four “fuel groups”, A, B, C, and D. The four fuel groups differed significantly in the amount of shrub (p=.0001), herbaceous plant (p=.0001), and litter biomass (p=.0007) found in each group. Predicted fire behavior varied between the four groups, with group B, the medium shrub group, producing the highest rate of spread (p=.313), and group C, the tall shrub group, producing the highest heat per unit area (p=.0055). The fuel and predicted fire behavior characteristics of the four fuel groups also differed from the standard models 2, 5, and 9.

uief_0068,Completion Report - Characterization of Sediment Cycle with Cesium-137 Dating Techniques,"Tennyson, L.C.",1983-09,Research Report,"The ever increasing demand for utilization of the land resource has generated concern about the potential for accelerated erosion associated with land use activities. Erosion is a natural process; however, land use activities often produce comparatively higher erosion rates. Soil particles detached from the land surface by flowing water can be delivered to nearby channels and transported to man-made water storage structures located downstream. The life spa of municipal, agriculture, and hydroelectric water supply reservoirs is often shortened because of accelerated deposition of sediments produced by increased upslope erosion associated with land use. Quantification of the rate of detachment, transport, and deposition of sediments, as related to natural and disturbed watershed conditions, is necessary if conservation of the soil resource is to be obtained and existing water reservoirs are to be protected. Continued research efforts are needed to develop and improve existing methods for quantifying the degree of erosion and rate of sediment deposition. One method of determining the rate of removal and deposition of sediments is to follow the fate of tagged sediments through the sedimentation cycle. A measurable tracer which is present in the existing environment and moves with detached sediment particles can be used to estimate the degree of eroded and deposited sediments on a watershed. Measurement of the concentration of the tracer on disturbed and undisturbed soil surfaces and in deposited reservoir sediments permits an assessment of erosion-deposition as related to degree of land use. The atmospheric nuclear explosions which occurred in the late 1950’s and early 1960’s produced fallout of several radioisotopes which were dispersed onto the land surface of the earth. One of these isotopes, Cesium-137, is strongly absorbed by most soil particles (Ritchie et al. 1973). Because of this absorption phenomena and the 330year half-life of this isotope a majority of 137Cs which has fallen to the earth’s surface is still present in the upper layers of the soil profile. The relative location and concentration of 137Cs in the soil or deposited soil profile can be used to assess the rate of soil particle detachment and deposition. Reservoir sediments deposited since the early 1950’s would have two distinct peaks of 137Cs accumulation which correspond to the 1959-60 and1962-64 period of maximum cesium fallout (HASL 1977). A third peak should also be present from fallout produced by the Chinese atmospheric nuclear detonation which occurred in 1976 (HASL 1976). Sediments deposited between these peak periods would have 137Cs present, but in lesser quantities. Similar analysis can be applied to watershed surfaces in the context of presence or absence of peak levels of isotope in the soil profile. Research conducted in the southern portion of the United States by Ritchie et al. (1973) and McHenry et al. (1973) indicate that 137Cs can be detected in soil and sediment profiles. These researchers were able to identify peak periods of 137Cs accumulation in soil and reservoir sediments. Atmospheric fallout records for Seattle and Forks, Washington, and Helena, Montana (Figure 2), indicate that sufficient levels of 137Cs have accumulated at the earth’s surface in the western United States to be quantified by gamma-ray spectrometric analysis (HASL 1977). Cesium-137 was measured in soil in eastern Montana at concentrations ranging from 0.524 to 2.217 nCi/Kg (McHenry et al. 1983). This project was designed to conduct a preliminary investigation of 137Cs levels in soils and deposited sediments at selected locations in northern Idaho and to assess the feasibility of using 137Cs as a sediment tracer. The objectives of the study were to: 1. Identify and quantify the distribution of 137Cs in disturbed and undisturbed soil profiles and in lake sediment cores. 2. Assess the feasibility of using 137Cs as a sediment tracer for evaluating the surface movement and storage components of the sedimentation cycle.",Big Meadow Creek; soils; deposition; sediment deposition; erosion; watershed management; Cesium-137; sediment transport; rate of detachment; soils,Big Meadow Creek,UIEF; Big Meadow Creek,46.799488,-116.812869,SW 1/4 S23,T40N,R4W,,,Department of Forest Resources,,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0068.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0068.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0068_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0068_th.jpg

Germination was greater on mineral soil seedbeds and the three burned seedbeds. Within the burned seedbeds, germination increased as duff decreased. The same trends were true for seedling establishment. Therefore, on burned and unburned seedbeds natural regeneration increased proportionally with decreasing duff thickness. At the end of the third growing season total height and basal diameter were recorded. Significant differences appeared between burned and unburned seedbeds, as well as differences between duff thicknesses for all species. Analysis of total above-ground coniferous biomass and number of trees showed significant differences between duff thickness, but not between burned and unburned seedbeds.

Complete fire exclusion in many areas creates dangerous fuel accumulations which result in catastrophic fires, insect and disease buildup, range deterioration, changes in wildlife carrying capacity, and decreased watershed yield (Ahlgren 1974). Where fuels are permitted to accumulate, fires increase in severity and damage, and offer much greater resistance to control (Dodge 1972). For these reasons prescribed burning, the planned ignition of grass, shrubs, or forest fuels to achieve a desired objective, is recognized as a valuable land management practice. This practice is extremely useful in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir ecosystems to attain management objectives such as 1) reduction of fire hazards after logging, 2) exposure of mineral soil for seedbeds, 3) control of insects and diseases, 4) thinning of dense stands of saplings, 5) increased yield and quality of forage, 6) improvement of big game habitat, and 7) modification of species composition in different plant communities (Habeck and Mutch 1975).",Douglas-fir; pseudotsuga menziesii; ninebark; northern Idaho; grazing; livestock; fire; ecological interactions; East Hatter Creek; forest ecology,East Hatter Creek,UIEF; East Hatter Creek,46.841245,-116.780864,S1,T40N,R4W,,Journal of Range Management,Department of Forest Resources,Journal of Range Management 37(2),https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/2vsn7u/alma9925337301851,SD427.G8Z5,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0075.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0075.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0075_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0075_th.jpg

uief_0084,"Residue Recovery, Transport, Densification, and Storage Economics, Activity 2","Johnson, Leonard R.; Lee, Harry W.; Hughes, Michael",1989-07-10,Research Article,"Chunkwood is a unique product that has been under development for several years in the United States and the Scandanavian countries. Chunks vary in size with the diameter of the piece being processed and can be manufactured to depths of 2.5 to 4.5 inches. The larger chunks allow air flow through the stored wood, decreasing the chances of spontaneous combustion and increasing the amount of drying while in storage. Increased combustion efficiency could also occur in wood burning units designed to handle larger chunks of wood. The product can be produced in the woods with equipment similar to whole tree chippers. Keeping the material in a chunk form also retains options for the production of products other than energy. An experimental prototype of a chunkwood processor was used to process logging residue and whole trees from thinning and clearcut operations. Three general methods were used to move the material from the woods to the processing point. Residue left after commercial timber harvest was moved to the roadside in a modified dozer piling operation. Earlier studies had suggested this as an efficient way to move the non-uniform residue material to an accessible point for processing. A second operation used a mechanical feller-buncher to cut and bunch trees from a dense, stagnant timber stand. Trees were skidded to the wood chunker with a grapple skidder.

White-tailed deer need old-growth or mature second-growth closed-canopy forests to provide sufficient thermal cover to withstand the cold north Idaho winters. Timber harvest can diminish the quality of white-tailed deer winter range by removing needed thermal cover. The goal of this research was to determine the location of suitable white-tailed deer winter range, according to land ownership, in the East Hatter Creek Watershed (EHCW). Digital orthophoto quadrangles @OQ) and hyperspectral images were analyzed using the GIs (geographic information system) program ARCVIEW. Currently there are 206 acres of suitable white-tailed deer winter range in the EHCW. The University of Idaho owns 101 acres (46%) and Bennett Lumber owns 117.5 acres (54%) of this acreage. Approximately 619 more acres will be available as winter range habitat in the EHCW as the forest matures and the canopy closes.

Evergreens have established themselves along major portions of the streams blocking sunlight needed by the less shade tolerant hardwood species. In limited areas where evergreen density was low and suitable hardwood speceis were found fresh beaver activity was also found.

The study site was divided into six 0.75-ha pastures and grazed at 6 prescribed levels of sheep herbivory during the summers of 1991 and 1992. Current year’s standing crop of shrubs and herbs was clipped within each of the 6 pastures. Species composition was estimated using the dry-weight-rank method. Vegetation was sampled in September (Fall) 1992, November (Winter) 1991, and 1992, and May (Spring) 1992 and 1993. Residual standing crop (RSC) remaining at the end of the grazing seasons within each of the 6 pastures varied from 278-2267 kg ha-1 in 1991, and 731-3016 kg ha-1 in 1992. Grab samples of all plant species were analyzed for crude protein (CP), available CP, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and acid detergent lignin. Regression analysis was used to compare the effects of sheep herbivory on forage quality and quantity for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianua ochrourus) and elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni). Summer sheep grazing at the levels administered in this study generally reduced the quantity of forage available to elk and white-tailed deer. Fall regrowth did occur in both years of the study, but did not compensate for forage removed by sheep. Summer sheep grazing reduced shrub standing crop the following spring in both 1992 and 1993, but herb production was increased as RSC decreased. Despite the reductions in standing crop, however, there was adequate standing crop to meet intake requirements for both elk and white-tailed deer. Forage quality was improved by sheep grazing in fall, but was generally decreased in the winter and late spring. Crude protein requirements for maintenance (5%) for both deer and elk were met in all treatments in Fall 1992, all in Winter 1991-92 except the 744 kg ha-1 RSC treatment, but only the 731 and 1042 kg ha-1 RSC treatments met this requirement for the Winter 1992-93.

uief_0096,Effects of Competition on the Postfire Recovery of Two Bunchgrass Species,"Defosse, Guillermo E.",1987-04,Thesis,"The relative fire effects of fire and competition on two bunchgrass species native to western North America, Agropyron spicatum and Festuca idahoensis, were investigated. These species were exposed to fire applied with a portable instrument that allowed control of fire temperature and duration for treatment of individual plants. Thirty plants of each species were subjected to different levels of competition by periodically removing all or part of the aerial biomass of neighboring plants within a radius of 0.6 m around a monitored bunchgrass plant. All plants received the same level of fire severity, an index of fire exposure calculated from the temperature/time integral for the meristematic crown region. No significant mortality due to fire was observed for plants of either species. Although Festuca did show meristematic tissue damage after fire, regrowth was more rapid than Agropyron, and was initiated within 15 days. Soil water availability restricted the regeneration of Festuca bunchgrass more than Agropyron. Only Agropyron plants without competition reached prefire productivity levels. Soil water potential was significantly more negative, by up to 50% for the 0-10-cm soil depth and up to 20% for the 10-20-cm soil depth, in plots with competition during the growing season. Temperatures in the upper 10-cm of the soil profile were significantly higher in plots without competition. Competition restricted aboveground productivity by approximately 70% for Agropyron and 115% for Festuca. Root production was inversely proportional to the degree of competition imposed for both species. The results suggest that both species are tolerant of fire under the fire severity imposed in this study. Their capacity to survive fires seems to be more related to the location of their respective root systems within the soil layers and to their capacity to compete for available soil water in the first stages of regrowth after the fire, than to the damaging effects caused directly by the fire.",East Hatter Creek; bunchgrass; postfire recovery; agropyron spicatum; festuca idahoensis; range resources,East Hatter Creek,UIEF; East Hatter Creek,46.840526,-116.780027,,,,,,Department of Rangeland Science,,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/2vsn7u/alma9941159601851,SB197.D4 1987,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0096.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0096.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0096_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0096_th.jpg

Timber harvesting, domestic livestock grazing and transportation systems have influenced these watersheds for nearly a century. Representative cross-sectional transects were established to characterize morphological, vegetative, and edaphic features for comparisons of reference and disturbed riparian ecosystems. Assessments of current riparian conditions and management alternatives were formulated through riparian-wetland guides designed by the United States Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service. Streams in grazed meadow and forest areas were 32% wider than ungrazed reaches. Mean bank angles for stream banks exposed to grazing were 15 degrees wider than undisturbed stream banks, exhibited poor bank stability, and had greater potential for erosion. High concentrations of fine sediments were found throughout, or immediately below, all grazed sections. Streams within grazed meadow areas contained an average of 76% fine sediments. In contrast, undisturbed forested reaches had 10% more bank undercuts, fewer fine sediments, stable banks, significantly greater shore water depth, and longer seasonal water flow. Evaluations of current stream conditions suggest that continuously disturbed riparian ecosystems may reduce natural functional processes such as sediment filtration and stream bank aggradations and increase flooding potential.

Scrib. & Smith, and seedlings of Pinus ponderosa (Dougl.) Lawson was examined within a pine/bunchgrass community. Canopy separation techniques and root exclusion tubes were used to determine the effects of bunchgrass competition on pine seedlings. Shoot interference from bunchgrass did not significantly affect pine seedling survival. In contrast, bunchgrass root exclusion increased survival of P. ponderosa seedlings. Physiological responses of P. ponderosa seedlings to water and high-temperature stress were also measured in the field and in a controlled greenhouse environment. Mortality significantly increased during periods with soil water potentials less than -1.5 MPa and soil surface temperatures greater than 60۫ C. Pinus ponderosa seedlings grown in the greenhouse developed physiological and morphological characteristics that indicated adaptation to dry environments. Drought-stressed seedlings exhibited higher root:total plant biomass ratios, and had significantly lower cell wall elasticity than watered seedlings, although osmotic potentials decreased to -2.5 MPa in all seedlings. Root:total plant biomass ratios greater than 0.78, along with rapid root growth to soil depths of 1m and greater, may have increased the ability of P. ponderosa seedlings to extract soil water. Calculated heat exchange rates showed that high transpiration rates maintained seedlings stem temperatures below 63۫C, which was determined to be the lethal temperature threshold in the field. Root exclusion experiments and modeled heat exchange both indicated that soil water availability strongly influenced P. ponderosa seedling survival on dry sites with high soil surface temperatures.",East Hatter Creek; ponderosa pine; pinus ponderosa; bunchgrass; bunchgrass competition; environmental stress; silviculture,East Hatter Creek,UIEF; East Hatter Creek,46.840526,-116.780027,,,,,,Department of Forest Resources,,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/2vsn7u/alma9952833401851,SD397.P6115K65 1995,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0099.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0099.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0099_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0099_th.jpg
uief_0100,An Assessment of Abandoned Railroad Grades in Riparian Areas in the University of Idaho Experimental Forest,"Loomis, Eric S.",2004-08,Thesis,"Timber harvesting has been occurring in the western United States since European settlers first arrived in the 1880s. In that time, it has been a significant source of disturbance to forest ecosystems. One aspect of this disturbance was the construction of railroad grades to transport harvested timber, which were often built in the riparian areas. My study examined abandoned railroad grades constructed on the University of Idaho Experimental Forest to determine whether there might be any residual disturbance to the riparian areas, as well as examining this disturbance in a historical context. Residual effects of railroad construction and use, in a comparison of graded and ungraded sites, were found throughout the riparian zones examined in my study. Light penetration was higher for ungraded, disturbed sites. Mean diameter at breast height (DBH) was highest on ungraded sites. However, there were no discernable differences in species composition or penetration resistance between graded and ungraded sites. Structurally, however, there were many areas where the railroad grades still existed and restricted the flow of the stream. Overall, the evidence suggests historic railroad construction and use may still have some effect on the function of the riparian areas. These effects appear to be primarily related to the physical restriction of stream channels and possibly erosion of stream banks. More study will be required to determine specifically how this restriction affects the riparian areas.",East Hatter Creek; West Hatter Creek; railroad grades; riparian ecosystems; railroad disturbance; forest resources,East Hatter Creek; West Hatter Creek,UIEF; East Hatter Creek; West Hatter Creek,46.83765,-116.824734,,,,,,Department of Forest Resources,,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/2vsn7u/alma9987734501851,QH541.5.F6L66 2004,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0100.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0100.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0100_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0100_th.jpg
uief_0101,Effects of Sheep Grazing on Tree Seedlings in a Northern Idaho Conifer Plantation,"MacRae, Steven J.",1996-04,Thesis,"Two studies were conducted near Moscow, Idaho over 4 years to evaluate the effects of sheep grazing intensity on Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) and sheep season of use on Douglas-fir and Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex laws.). The grazing intensity study was conducted on a 4-year-old conifer plantation during 1991- 1992. Four pastures were grazed plus an ungrazed control. Grazing intensity averaged over the 2 years ranged from65 to 78.5% utilization of the available forage. Tree seedling height growth in the heaviest grazed treatment did not differ from the ungrazed control (p>0.10), and was at least 35% greater (p≤0.10) than the other grazed treatments. Diameter growth of tree seedlings in the heaviest grazed treatment exceeded the other 4 treatments by 32-49% (p≤0.10). Lateral browsing and terminal clipping did not differ (p≥0.10) in the heaviest grazed treatment compared to the ungrazed control in both years of the study. Treatments did not differ (p>0.10) in rodent damage, trampling, or tree seedling mortality. In 1991, about 3-4 weeks after grazing ceased, lower tree seedling xylem water potential (p≤0.10) and greater soil moisture levels (p≤0.10) were recorded in the heaviest grazed treatment compared to ungrazed control. The season of grazing study was conducted during 1993-1994 on a portion of the same site as the aforementioned study. The treatments used during the study were early and late summer grazing and an ungrazed control. Greater lateral browsing (p≤0.10) and terminal clipping (p≤0.10) of Douglas-fir occurred in the late treatment of 1993 compared to early and control treatments. In 1994, lateral browsing did not differ (p>0.10) among treatments and greater terminal clipping (p≤0.10) occurred in the early grazed treatment compared to the late and control treatments. Douglas-fir seedling damage was reflected in reduced (p≤0.10) height and diameter growth for both early and late grazed treatments compared to the ungrazed control.

uief_0102,Effects of Season of Use on Quality and Botanical Composition of Sheep Diets Within a Northern Idaho Conifer Plantation,"Mbabaliye, Theogene",1996-11,Thesis,"The effect of season use on quality and botanical composition of sheep (Ovis aries) diets within a northern Idaho conifer plantation was examined during the summers of 1993, 1994 and 1995. The grazing seasons were in early and late summer. The botanical composition of sheep diets averaged 58% graminoids, 27% forbs, 11% shrubs and 4% conifers during the entire study period. The average graminoid content of sheep diets tended to be higher in the early summer grazing season compared to the late summer grazing season. The interaction between the three years and the two grazing seasons was significant for both forb and shrub content in the sheep diets (p<0.10). The conifer composition of the sheep diets was lowest when the graminoid content was highest in the early grazing season of 1993 and 1994. The same was true with respect to the shrub use by the sheep. Relative preference index values indicated that sheep selected first for graminoids, followed by the forbs and then shrubs. Diet quality results tended to be high in fecal nitrogen (FN) in the early grazing season. The fecal diaminopimelic acid (FDAPA) levels appeared to be high in the early grazing season in each of the two grazing seasons over the three years of the study. Data in this study demonstrated that sheep can obtain diverse forage within a conifer plantation with a minimum consumption of conifers, especially in the early summer grazing season. The forage consumed at this time was also generally higher in both FN and FDAPA levels.",Flat Creek; sheep diet; season of use; botanical composition; diet quality; sheep; range resources,Flat Creek,UIEF; Flat Creek,46.851013,-116.724478,,,,,,Department of Rangeland Science,,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/2vsn7u/alma9954806601851,SF376.M33 1996,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0102.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0102.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0102_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0102_th.jpg
uief_0103,Performance and Diets of Sheep Grazing Within a Northern Idaho Conifer Plantation,"McCoy, Scott D.",1995-06,Thesis,"The performance and diets of sheep (Ovis aries) grazing within a 4-year-old conifer plantation in northern Idaho were examined. The study site was divided into five 0.75-ha pastures and grazed at 5 herbage allowance HA levels during the summers of 1991 and 1992. HA levels ranged from 1.71 to 3.78 kg DM sheep-1 day-1 in 1991 and from 2.25 to 3.91 kg DM sheep-1 day-1 in 1992. Sheep grazed the pastures for 78 and 64 days in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Sheep weights and current year’s standing crop of shrubs and herbs were monitored immediately before the animals entered the pastures, at monthly intervals, and at termination of each year’s grazing season. When sheep were weighed, fecal grab samples were collected and subsequently analyzed for 2,6-diaminopimelic acid (FDAPA) and botanical composition using microhistological procedures. Regression analysis was used to determine whether average daily gain (ADG) and FDAPA were related to HA. Dietary overlap among the HA levels was evaluated using Kulczynski’s similarity index. Relative forage preferences indices (RPI) were calculated. Seasonlong ADG was positively related to HA in 1991 and from-14 to 45g in 1992. Results indicated that in 1991, when vegetative growing conditions were favorable, HA of ≥ 2.06 kg DM sheep-1 day-1 was required to achieve ADG of 110g. In 1992, when growing conditions were unfavorable, ADG only reached 45 g when HA was 3.91 kg DM sheep-1 day-1. Seasonlong FDAPA levels were not related to HA in either year (p=0.21 in 1991; p=0.84 in 1992). FDAPA ranged from 0.66 to 0.81 mg g fecal DM-1 in 1991 and from 0.62 to 0.73 mg g fecal DM-1 in 1992.There was a weak positive relationship between FDAPA and HA (p=0.12) from 16 August to 31 August 1991. ADG was related to FDAPA from 16 July to 15 August 1991 (p=0.06) and from 16 August to 31 August 1991 (p=0.01). Seasonlong dietary overlap ranged from 49 to 80% in 1991 and from 41 to79% in 1992 indicating that diets of the sheep were quite similar across grazing treatments considering the species diversity of the plant community within the conifer plantation. Major species in the sheep diets included redstem ceanothus (Ceanothus sanguineus Pursh), Scouler willow (Salix scouleriana Barratt), and ninebark (Physocarpus malvaceus [L.] Kuhn). RPI across treatments showed that the sheep selected for graminoids and shrubs seemed to avoid forbs. Results indicate that environmental conditions (e.g., temperature and precipitation) during spring and summer have marked effect on sheep performance. Sheep producers and forest managers must work together for prescribed sheep grazing to work smoothly within a conifer plantation. Most sheep producers will be reluctant to graze conifer plantations at high intensities that result in decreased sheep performance. Therefore, forest managers desiring the benefits from higher grazing intensities should consider expected sheep performance when establishing grazing fees.",Flat Creek; sheep diet; grazing; sheep performance; grazing areas; grazing treatments; range resources,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,,Department of Rangeland Science,,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/2vsn7u/alma9953258401851,SF375.4.I2M23 1995,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0103.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0103.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0103_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0103_th.jpg

The area never received a formal management plan. Consequently, it received very little management input, beyond basic maintenance. The purpose of this study was to provide estimates of present recreation use and user preferences for facilities, as a basis for future management decisions for the area. A stratified random sample of groups using the area during the study period extending from July 1, 1973 to June 30, 1974 formed the basis for the use and preference estimates. Total estimated recreation use of Big Meadow Creek Recreation Area for the one-year study period was 14,528 visitor-hours . Over 90 percent of this use occurred in the intervals of July through September, and Nay and June. Approximately 80 percent of the use occurred on weekends. Use of the area was primarily day-use recreation, with activities being mainly picnicking, hiking, nature study, sports activities, and general leisure. Users were mostly families and organized groups from Pullman and Troy, Idaho. The area also received use for beer parties by college students from Moscow. This was confined to weekends in the spring and fall months. User opinions on the quality and quantity of existing recreation facilities at Big Meadow Creek Recreation Area varied widely. By general consensus, both quality and quantity of drinking water at the site was considered inadequate. Certain other facilities, such as picnic tables and parking areas were considered adequate. Opinions on the quality and quantity of most facilities, however, were divided for different types of user groups.

A forage inventory was made in which a cover-type map of the area was produced based on an ecological classification of the vegetation. The map depicts the location and size of the area occupied by each of the various success ional stages of vegetation, the zones and habitat types of which these stages are a part, and the dominant species present in the canopy and understory. The percentage of ground cover and the species composition of that cover were determined by the line interception method of sampling vegetation. The shrub species present were divided into two categories according to whether or not they are generally considered to be preferred as browse by white-tailed deer in this area. It was found that the ratio of preferred to non-preferred species varied between cover types, but that the two classes of shrubs were present in approximately equal ratio on the area as a whole. Four of the preferred species (willow, redstem ceanothus, western redcedar, and serviceberry) were studied to determine the effects of snow depths on the availability of browse. These determinations were hampered by mild weather conditions during the winter, and accumulated snow depths of more than 18 inches were rare. The amount of snow on the ground at any time varied considerably between the cover types. Percentages of total browse available with snow covers of approximately 1 foot and 1 ½ feet were as follows: willow, 97.1 and 92.8; redstem ceanothus, 67.4 and 49.3; western redcedar, 55.8 and 54.2, respectively. Percentage differences between species were due to differences in the distribution of current growth among the various height levels of the plants, and in the susceptibility of the branches of these species to bending under the weight of snow. The maximum accumulated depth on the serviceberry plot was 8 inches; the browse on these plants remained 100 percent available. A clipping experiment was initiated to determine the ability of redstem ceanothus to withstand various degrees of forage removal. Three clipping intensities were employed, in each of which forage was removed in amounts that left a predetermined number of buds on each twig, as follows; 0, 1 and 3 buds, respectively. All four plants in each group were subjected to the same treatment. In addition, four plants were unclipped and served as a control group. Each of the clipped plants showed a large gain in linear production and average twig length, as contrasted to a net loss in each of the control plants. Flower production was drastically reduced on the clipped plants, but was normal in the control group. Results are available for only one growing season following the start of the experiment, and are not representative of what may be expected over a period of several years of annual clipping at the same intensities.",East Hatter Creek; white-tailed deer browse; browse; white-tailed deer; ungulates; available browse; forest resources,East Hatter Creek,UIEF; East Hatter Creek,46.834119,-116.801181,,,,,,Department of Forest Resources,,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/2vsn7u/alma9937630501851,SD427.G8B3,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0113.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0113.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0113_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0113_th.jpg

The site of investigation was an area of cut-over forest on the Flat Creek Block of the University of Idaho Experimental Forest, Latah County, Idaho. During late June and early July, ruffed grouse were found in both the Cedar-hemlock and Douglas fir zones. As the summer advanced, broods moved to the ravines during the day. Logging roads and railroad grades were used as evening feeding areas from about mid-august until at least mid-November. In the summer and fall of 1959, twenty-four grouse were banded. Six out of twenty grouse killed during the hunting season on the Flat Creek area were banded. The total kill represented about 13 percent of the fall population on the area. The banded juvenile grouse moved a maximum distance of 0.29 miles and a minimum distance of 0.04 miles in fall dispersal. The short period of time from the date of banding to the date the bird was killed or observed suggested that the dispersal distances were minimized. Although sufficient data are lacking, juvenile females moved farther than males. In addition, there was a tendency of the birds to move in a southerly direction up the major drainage system of the area. Grouse were found using the spur ridges, slopes, and ravines for their winter habitat. Very few birds were found wintering on the main Abies grandis/Pachistima habitat types. Grouse found on all aspects during the winter. The winter concluded that the wintering habitat of grouse overlapped the summer brood habitat in 1960. The habitat of the drumming males was on the spur ridges and slopes as opposed to the more extensive winter habitat. The cover in the Abies grandis/Pachistima habitat type was preferred by male grouse, although the use of more than one habitat type was indicated. Males showed no preferences for one aspect over others. Cocks selected large, rotten, moss-covered logs for drumming, and they commonly used more than one log during the drumming season. Thirty-eight drumming males were located on the Flat Creek area. A spring density of 5.4 drumming males per hundred acres was estimated for the area. Fifteen males were captured with mirror-traps and marked. The age composition of the trapped cocks consisted of about twice as many juveniles (one-year-olds) as adults (two years or older). Although the sample size is small, these data indicated that the ruffed grouse population on the Flat Creek area is reproducing well.",ruffed grouse; grouse; grouse habitat; seasonal habitat; species movement; Flat Creek; wildlife,Flat Creek,UIEF; Flat Creek,46.862906,-116.723791,,,,,,Department of Wildlife Resources,,,QL696.G285E7,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0117.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0117.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0117_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0117_th.jpg
uief_0118,Nocturnal Behavior of White-Tailed Deer in the Hatter Creek Enclosure,"Gladfelter, Harold Lee",1966-07,Thesis,"The nocturnal behavior of white-tailed deer was studied in the 800-acre Hatter Creek deer enclosure in northern Idaho. Techniques used for locating and observing the deer at night were small neon blinkers and sheep bells which had been attached to collars on captured deer, an infrared sniperscope, electronic counting devices used for movement studies, and observation perches used for direct observation of behavior. The nocturnal movement of deer was greater in the evening than in the morning and was related to change in light intensity after sunset and before sunrise. The length of the nocturnal activity periods was related to decreases in temperature and increases in humidity.

Two of the plots were one-fifth acre in size. One of these was thinned. Three plots were two-fifths acre in size. Two of these plots were thinned. The thinnings removed twelve, eighteen, and twenty-three percent of the basal area originally on the plots. The residential basal areas on all the plots varied from seventy-eight to one hundred and forty square feet per acre. On selected serviceberry stems, the living annual growth for the past four years was measured. Buds and fruiting stalks were counted. Average twig length by plots by years was expressed as a percentage of the 1950 average. Total twig length by plots by years was expressed as a percentage of the 1950 length. The total growth of individual stems for each year was expressed as a percentage of the 1950 growth lumped by plots and the percentages averaged. The total growth of individual plants for 1950-1951 was compared with 1952-1953 as a ratio. The curve of the thinned one-fifth acre plot follows the trend of its control both before and after the thinning. The curves of the two-fifth plots are inconsistent. The ratios were inconsistent within all plots. No significant difference could be demonstrated between the various thinned plots and their respective controls for bud production or number of fruiting stalks. In each plot, nine sub-plots totaling 84.6 square feet were clipped. Grasses, forbs, shrub current growth was harvested. This was dried and weighed. No difference in productivity due to thinning could be demonstrated between the thinned plots and their respective controls. Loop tallies on the foliage and stems within the sub-plots showed that there may have been a slight increase in the occurrence of grasses and sedges. Loop tallies on the litter show that all thinned plots have more conifer (needle) litter than do the controls. The controls in turn have a slightly greater amount of both hardwood litter and herbaceous litter than do the thinned plots. The thinned plots have 135-200 percent more small woody material (less than three-eighths inch in diameter) on the ground than do the controls. List-quadrat tallies were found unsatisfactory for the type of vegetation being studied. Measurements of light grey intensity within the forest were also tried and found inconsistent by the methods used. The shrub and ground-cover data collected two years after the thinning failed to show any difference between thinned and control plots which could be attributed to the thinning. It appears that the differences which exist are due to the inherent qualities of the individual plots.",ruffed grouse; white-tailed deer; browse; range; Flat Creek; East Hatter Creek; wildlife,East Hatter Creek; Flat Creek,UIEF; East Hatter Creek; Flat Creek,46.840526,-116.780027,,,,,,Department of Wildlife Resources,,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/2vsn7u/alma9937609201851,SD396.5.M37,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0128.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0128.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0128_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0128_th.jpg

Another study is now being carried on to determine proper use of the redstem ceanothus after the growing season. The current study showed that considerable browsing takes place during the summer, and it is recommended that the research be expanded to obtain data regarding the effects of browsing during the growing season as well. The Hatter Creek Enclosure was established primarily for research on white-tailed deer on an intensive scale. One phase of research that has not yet been studied is the carrying capacity. Therefore, it is recommended that a survey be made of the available browse on a minimum winter range. These data, plus a reasonably accurate estimate of the present population and additional productivity information, would determine an accurate annual allowable kill for the area. After carrying capacity has been determined, the next step should be an attempt at experimental habitat improvement, in the form of logging. At the present time, most of the heaviest used winter range is in the timbered portions at the northern end of the enclosure. These areas produce small amounts of the more palatable winter browse species. It is recommended that these areas be logged in small blocks, not to exceed two or three acres, in order to encourage growth of these plants. It is also recommended that detailed records be kept of the vegetational composition, both before and at regular intervals after the logging, to see if the desired ecological changes have taken place. The only conclusions that can be drawn from the productivity phase of this study, are that white-tail does sampled at Hatter Creek bred for the first time at approximately 16 months of age, and usually produce a single fawn which is born during the month of June.",white-tailed deer; food habitat of white-tailed deer; browse; wildlife,East Hatter Creek,UIEF; East Hatter Creek,46.836471,-116.802608,,,,,,Department of Wildlife Resources,,,QL737.U55R62,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,application/pdf,eng,,uief_0129.pdf,pdf_preview,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/uief_0129.pdf,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/small/uief_0129_sm.jpg,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/uief/thumbs/uief_0129_th.jpg

Check station data and life tables showed that hunters selectively killed bucks. Reproductive performance was estimated from a sample of 32 does; an average of 2.00 + 0.64 ova were produced per ovulating doe. Mortality of oocytes averaged 9 percent. The reproductive performance for all age classes was estimated at 1.42 fawns per doe. Spotlight counts showed that does lost an average of 0.6 fawns by fall. The estimated herd increase during the fawning period was 86 percent. Productivity measured at birth and again before the hunting season was 46 + 10 and 30 + 6 percent, respectively. Because some samples were small, the estimates of productivity may not be completely representative of northern Idaho white-tails. Hunting success on deer in an 800 acre enclosure is compared with the hunting success on an adjacent free-ranging herd. Deer density in both areas approached 30 per square mile.

However, information on soil pipe formation, morphology, and distribution on forested hillslopes is very limited, impeding the incorporation of these important preferential flow pathways into mechanistic hydrologic models. The objectives of this study were to (i) quantify the spatial distribution and physical characteristics of soil pipes, (ii) investigate soil pipe origin, and (iii) examine the role of fire in pipe formation. We excavated three 6.12‐ by 6.12‐m plots down to a water‐restricting horizon within a 2‐ha portion of a steep forest hillslope in northern Idaho. Excavation followed consecutive timber harvest and prescribed burning operations. Detailed documentation of soil pipe diameter, direction, gradient, and connectivity from these excavated soil profiles were used to derive morphologic attributes and distribution of soil pipes. The majority of soil pipes were attributed to decayed tree roots with a median depth of 0.32 m corresponding to the beginning of the restrictive soil horizon. Median path length for branched and nonbranched soil pipes was 2.21 m and 0.89 m, respectively with a median tortuosity of 1.23. Our findings indicate that soil pipe formation and distribution within this hillslope was influenced by tree root growth, decay, slope gradient, and root limiting soil horizons. Fire and the combustion of roots and tree stumps was the primary mechanism that connected soil pipes to the surface. The large frequency and extent of soil pipes documented in this study suggests that estimations of water transport without consideration for these macropores, while useful, are likely underestimated.",UIEF; soil research; soils; restrictive horizons; Flat Creek; soil pipes; large horizontal macropores; root decay; fire effects; soil pipe formation; soils,Flat Creek,Flat Creek; UIEF,46.851013,-116.724478,,,,,"The Soil Science Society of America, Inc.",Environmental Science,,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_gale_infotracmisc_A379493750,,doi:10.2136/sssaj2014.01.0008,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,https://doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2014.01.0008,,

However, the limited capacity to characterize these pathways in situ remains a major limitation for process-based understanding and incorporation into coupled hydrologic models. The goal of this study was to investigate the use of pseudo-three-dimensional electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) as a field method for characterizing soil-pipe spatial distribution and connectivity on a forested hillslope with a specific interest in detecting the formation of soil pipes from root decay and combustion. We conducted detailed ERT surveys on three 6.12- by 6.12-m plots before and after a prescribed burn located on a 2-ha clearcut of coniferous forest underlain by a fragipan. Excavation following the ERT measurements showed that soil pipes were mostly empty with 86% containing <25% decaying root matter. The mean diameter of pipes was 4.3 cm with a mean length of 1.6 m. Such empty pipes would resolve as elongated high-electrical resistivity features. However, a high resistivity layer corresponding to the Bw and BE soil horizons overlaying a fragipan was observed on all plots with the majority of soil pipes larger than 1 cm diameter occurring within these horizons. The lack of observable contrast between pipes and the high resistivity layer as well as reduced data coverage within the vicinity of large soil pipes may have limited our ability to effectively characterize soil pipes occurring within these hillslopes.

However, GNSS positional accuracy for ground workers in motion may be reduced by multipath error, satellite signal obstruction, or other factors. Radio propagation of GNSS locations may also be impacted due to line-of-sight (LOS) obstruction in remote, forested areas. The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of forest stand characteristics, topography, and other LOS obstructions on the GNSS accuracy and radio signal propagation quality of multiple Raveon Atlas PT GNSS-RF transponders functioning as a network in a range of forest conditions. Because most previous research with GNSS in forestry has focused on stationary units, we chose to analyze units in motion by evaluating the time-to-signal accuracy of geofence crossings in 21 randomly-selected stands on the University of Idaho Experimental Forest. Specifically, we studied the effects of forest stand characteristics, topography, and LOS obstructions on (1) the odds of missed GNSS-RF signals, (2) the root mean squared error (RMSE) of Atlas PTs, and (3) the time-to-signal accuracy of safety geofence crossings in forested environments.

uief_0138,Western U.S. Forest Carbon Balance in the 21st Century: Improving Projections with Improved Disturbance Monitoring and Modeling,"Stenzel, Jeffrey E.",2021,Dissertation,"The forests of the western United States face profound impacts from shifts in climate, natural disturbance regimes, and land management in the 21st century. Under novel conditions, forest ecosystem services will be altered, including impacts to forest climate moderation, resource provision, and biodiversity. However, the complex processes that determine present-day observed forest structure and composition across the complex terrain of the region are incompletely understood. As a result, scientists and land managers are confronted with considerable uncertainty as to how widespread natural and human impacts upon forests will result in changed processes and states. This dissertation employs model-observation frameworks to examine and improve upon the understanding of how disturbance will impact western U.S. forest carbon balances from site to regional scales. Chapter 1 addresses deficiencies in current process model representations of direct emissions and ecosystem mortality transfers during forest fire. In this study, I incorporate novel observations and modify an ecosystem biogeochemical model to compare to model default assumptions. Projected carbon balance impacts of observation-based vs model-based assumption are then quantified in: 1) A carbon dense forest via a modified Daycent biogeochemical model; 2) Across the western United States from 2000-2016. At the state level, model default assumptions lead to 50-110% overestimates in carbon emissions, primarily due to the unrealistic combustion of live tree bole biomass and compounded by a lack of standing-dead biomass pool representation. Projections demonstrate that emissions overestimates can increase to 300-500% in carbon dense forests (e.g. old growth) in the midterm (30 years) due to altered decomposition. Chapter 2 quantifies the carbon and water balance impacts of an experimental selective thinning in a ponderosa pine forest in the University of Idaho Experimental Forest. I use automated and traditional ecosystem stock and flux measurements to estimate the impacts of treatments from 2016-2019 at contrasting tree and stand scales, with a focus on the balance between primary producer density reductions and mitigated summer drought stress. I then project the on and off-site carbon balance impacts of treatment through 2050 with a life cycle assessment (LCA) and with the Daycent biogeochemical model. Projections allow the exploration of whether carbon parity with control stands is reached within common emissions reduction time periods. Observations indicated an average 30% increase in thinned stand residual tree growth. In contrast to the control stand, treated stand tree transpiration persisted through the summer drought period. However, production and water use increases did not compensate for tree density reductions and both yearly Net Primary Production (NPP) and transpiration decreased in treatment stands. Projections demonstrated that large harvest-event emissions pulses from long-lived woody biomass pools led to long carbon deficit legacies; treatment carbon storage parity with control stands was not reached by 2050. Chapter 3 employs a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) to simulate chapter 2 stand dynamics and examine model applicability for simulations across a northern Rocky Mountain ecoregion domain. The FATES DGVM simulates forest composition and structure, disturbance regimes, biogeochemistry, and biophysics, operating within the Community Land Model 5 (CLM5) of the Community Earth Systems Model (CESM).

uief_0139,Hydraulic Properties and Processes of Conifer Trees in the Inland Northwest Through Extended Seasonal Drought,"Baker, Kathryn V.",2019-08,Dissertation,"The overarching question of this dissertation is: how do conifer trees in Northern Idaho use water across long growing seasons with little precipitation? There are four chapters, an introductory chapter first followed by three research projects. All three projects took place on the University of Idaho Experimental Forest. As in the much of the region, the soils on the experimental forest can hold large amounts of water because of their depth and composition (more than a meter-deep silt loam). Paired with a climate that allows for very little summer precipitation, the soils facilitate a slow and consistent dry down. That allowed us to study trees’ responses to drought and how they changed throughout growing seasons. The first research project described here was conducted in 2015 addresses the question: how do six of the most regionally important conifer species function from June to October of the worst drought on record? That study produced an interesting dataset that, in collaboration with Drs. Xiaonan Tai and Scott Mackay (now of University of Utah and SUNY-Buffalo, respectively), was incorporated into the TREES process-based tree physiology model. We can now model those species under different scenarios of climate and substrate. However, that project inspired a question: how do specific parameters, like whole-tree conductance, whole-tree water flux, organ conductivity, and leaf gas exchange interact through a growing season? Chapter three addresses that question by describing intensely measured water use of three individual mature P. ponderosa trees from June to October of 2017. The insights that chapter provided were then scaled up to the fourth chapter, which explores the influence that different densities of pre-commercial thinning treatments have on P. ponderosa tree hydraulic function within the same site in 2018. Each of these three research projects produced some results that were expected and consistent with literature and also some novel findings that add new insights to our understanding of conifers in the inland Northwest.",UIEF; conifer hydraulic properties; hydraulic properties; conifers; drought; tree response; whole-tree conductance; whole-tree water flux; leaf gas exchange; Flat Creek; silviculture,Flat Creek,UIEF; Flat Creek,46.851013,-116.724478,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations Publishing,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_proquest_journals_2448280554,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,,,

Burning conditions were moderately cool with 10-hr time-lag fuel moisture varying from 11 to 19%. Preburn and postburn fuel loadings were determined by use of the planar intersect method. Preburn data indicated greater fuel accumulations in grazed stands, 55,460 kg/ha, as compared to ungrazed stands, 44,710 kg/ha. Difficulty in achieving a satisfactory rate-of-spread and fire intensity was encountered due to the combined effects of a very dry summer followed by a wet fall. Moist conditions on the study site, lack of fine fuels, and accumulation of heavy fuels in the grazed portion produced a burn of patchy nature. Fire rate of spread varied from 0 to 183 cm/minute with flame height up to 91 cm. Result was a fuel reduction of 60.2% in the grazed stand and 35.2% in the ungrazed stand.

One of the largest uncertainties in climate change predictions is due to limitations in our understanding of the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). This dissertation investigated SOA formation from the oxidation of plant and leaf litter emissions in a laboratory chamber. To accurately measure the biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions, a dynamic dilution system was developed and is described in the first study. This system was used to calibrate the GC-MS-FID and improve quantitation with a maximum instrumental error of ±10%. In the second study, two separate sets of soil and leaf litter samples were transported from the University of Idaho experimental forest and brought back to the lab. The BVOC emissions from these samples were pumped to an aerosol growth chamber where they were oxidized to generate SOA. The resulting SOA composition was similar to SOA formed from the oxidation of other biogenic SOA precursors. Soil/leaf litter BVOC missions were compared to a canopy emission model and contributed from 12-136% of canopy emissions during spring and fall. Results suggest this could be a significiant emission source during those times of the year. In the third and fourth study, coniferous plants were treated with a plant hormone, methyl jasmonate, to simulate herbivory stress. The third study focused on the plant responses to the stress treatment by investigating changes to the BVOC emission profile. There was a high degree of inter- and intra-plant species variability. Some of the compounds most affected by the stress treatment were alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, limonene, 1,8-cineol, beta-myrcene, terpinolene, and the aromatic cymene isomers. The fourth study investigated changes to SOA composition due to changes in the BVOC emission profiles. Most pre-treatment SOA was very similar in composition with Pearson correlation coefficients between the AMS spectra greater than 0.88. The SOA generated after MeJA treatment produced aerosol mass spectra with similar m/z enhancements. This could indicate an herbivory stress mass spectral fingerprint that could be used to identify plant stress at an ecosystem scale.",UIEF; atmospheric aerosols; biogenic secondary organic aerosol; plant and leaf litter emissions; emissions; secondary organic aerosol; SOA; biogenic volatile organic compound; BVOC; plant stress identifiers; environmental science,Big Meadow Creek,UIEF; Big Meadow Creek,46.799488,-116.812869,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations Publishing,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_proquest_journals_1624964516,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,,,
uief_0144,Idaho Forest Growth Response to Post-Thinning Energy Biomass Removal and Complementary Soil Amendments,"Sherman, Lauren A.; Page‐Dumroese, Deborah S.; Coleman, Mark D.",2018-04,Research Article,"Utilization of woody biomass for biofuel can help meet the need for renewable energy production. However, there is a concern biomass removal will deplete soil nutrients, having short‐ and long‐term effects on tree growth. This study aimed to develop short‐term indicators to assess the impacts of the first three years after small‐diameter woody biomass removal on forest productivity to establish optimal biomass retention levels for mixed‐conifer forests in the Inland Northwest region, and to evaluate the ability of soil amendments to compensate for potential adverse effects from biomass removal. We examined impacts of four biomass retention‐level treatments at two study locations: full biomass removal (0x), full biomass retention (1x), double biomass retention (2x), and unthinned control. We combined biomass retention with four soil amendment treatments: biochar (B), fertilizer (F), fertilizer and biochar combined (FB), and an untreated control (C). We considered treatment effects on basal area and total stem volume growth for all trees per plot (plot trees) and for the six largest trees per plot (crop trees). Biomass removal had no effect on plot (P > 0.40) or crop tree growth (P > 0.65) compared to normal biomass retention. High biomass retention (2x) decreased plot tree growth as compared to normal biomass retention (1x) levels (P < 0.05) after three years. This growth difference was not explained by soil moisture, temperature, or nutrient uptake. While there were strong tree growth differences between study locations, patterns of biomass and amendment treatment responses did not differ. Fertilizer increased basal area growth and total volume growth (P < 0.10) as expected, because nitrogen is limiting in the region. Biochar had no effect on tree growth (P > 0.47). Initial findings after three years suggest removing small‐diameter biomass for biofuel feedstocks is feasible in the Inland Northwest without negative impacts on tree growth. There is concern that removal of biomass for biofuel production will degrade future forest productivity. Forest basal area growth did not decrease during three years after thinning when all biomass was removed at two study locations in Idaho. However, growth did decrease with retention of high levels of downed woody debris.

W.",2021-02-05,Research Article,"Western US forests represent a carbon sink that contributes to meeting regional and global greenhouse gas targets. Forest thinning is being implemented as a strategy for reducing forest vulnerability to disturbance, including mortality from fire, insects, and drought, as well as protecting human communities. However, the terrestrial carbon balance impacts of thinning remain uncertain across regions, spatiotemporal scales, and treatment types. Continuous and in situ long‐term measurements of partial harvest impacts to stand‐scale carbon and water cycle dynamics are nonetheless rare. Here, we examine post‐thinning carbon and water flux impacts in a young ponderosa pine forest in Northern Idaho. We examine in situ stock and flux impacts during the 3 years after treatment as well as simulate the forest sector carbon balance through 2050, including on and off‐site net emissions. During the observation period, increases in tree‐scale net primary production (NPP) and water use persistence through summer drought did not overcome the impacts of density reduction, leading to 45% annual reductions of NPP. Growth duration remained constrained by summer drought in control and thinned stands. Ecosystem model and life cycle assessment estimates demonstrated a net forest sector carbon deficit relative to control stands of 27.0 Mg C ha−1 in 2050 due to emissions from dead biomass pools despite increases to net ecosystem production. Our results demonstrate dynamics resulting in carbon losses from forest thinning, providing a baseline with which to inform landscape‐scale modeling and assess tradeoffs between harvest losses and potential gains from management practices.

However, it is possible that biomass removal can deplete nutrients from soil, which can alter soil respiration (Rs) and exoenzyme properties, and potentially impact tree growth. This study evaluates the impact of biomass removal on Rs and exoenzyme properties and the capacity of soil amendments to counteract any potential effects. At two study locations, we created four post‐thinning biomass retention levels: full biomass removal (0×), full biomass retention (1×), double biomass retention (2×), and a no‐thin treatment. Four soil amendment treatments were applied to each biomass retention level: N fertilizer (F), biochar (B), fertilizer plus biochar (FB), and an untreated control (C). We evaluated treatment effects on Rs and activity of four exoenzymes to represent C‐cycling, N‐release, and P‐release processes. Biomass retention levels had no effect on Rs (p = .42) or exoenzyme activities (p > .29). Variation in exoenzyme activity was explained by location, season, soil organic matter, soil moisture content, and temperature. Variation in Rs was explained by the same variables, in addition to C‐cycling exoenzyme activity and soil pH. Soil amendments had no effect on exoenzyme activities (p > .49), and no main effect on Rs (p = .48), though amendments influenced Rs differently at each location (p = .02). Short‐term findings suggest small‐diameter biomass removal for cellulosic biofuel production will not impact Rs and exoenzyme properties, and paired with our tree growth study, provide evidence that biofuel systems are a feasible renewable energy source in the western North America. Forest biomass removed after thinning of western American forests has potential to provide abundant bioenergy feedstocks. However, there is concern that removing residual biomass from thinning operations will degrade microbial decomposition and nutrient cycling functions through decreased detrital inputs. Microbial processes, measured with soil respiration and exoenzyme activity were little affected in the second and third years after various combinations of forest thinning, biomass removal, and compensatory amendments of biochar and nitrogen fertilization. Forest microbial functions appear to be resilient to biomass removal for bioenergy production in the years following treatment.

Real-time positioning that uses global navigation satellite system (GNSS) technology paired with radio frequency transmission (GNSS-RF) has the potential to reduce fatal and non-fatal accidents on logging operations through the use of geofences that define safe work areas. Until recently, most geofences have been static boundaries. The aim of this study was to evaluate factors affecting mobile geofence accuracy in order to determine whether virtual safety zones around moving ground workers or equipment are a viable option for improving situational awareness on active timber sales. We evaluated the effects of walking pace, transmission interval, geofence radius, and intersection angle on geofence alert delay using a replicated field experiment. Simulation was then used to validate field results and calculate the proportion of GNSS error bearings resulting in early alerts. The interaction of geofence radius and intersection angle affected safety geofence alert delay in the field experiment. The most inaccurate alerts were negative, representing early warning. The magnitude of this effect was largest at the greatest intersection angles. Simulation analysis supported these field results and also showed that larger GNSS error corresponded to greater variability in alert delay. Increasing intersection angle resulted in a larger proportion of directional GNSS error that triggered incorrect, early warnings. Because the accuracy of geofence alerts varied greatly depending on GNSS error and angle of approach, geofencing for occupational safety is most appropriate for general situational awareness unless real-time correction methods to improve accuracy or higher quality GNSS-RF transponders are used.",UIEF; geofence; logging hazards; GNSS; mobile geofence accuracy; virtual safety zones; logging safety; forest operations,East Hatter Creek,UIEF; East Hatter Creek,46.8402,-116.864634,,,,358,MDPI,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_pubmed_primary_28394303,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,,,

The purpose of this paper is to (1) review the related literature for audiences not familiar with remote sensing and tracking technologies and (2) to identify knowledge gaps in operational forestry and forest operations research now that these new data and systems are becoming more common. Recent Findings Past research has led to successful development of ITD remote sensing methods for detecting individual tree information and radio frequency identification (RFID), branding, and other product tracing methods for individual trees and logs. Blockchain and cryptocurrency that allow independent verification of transactions and work activity recognition based on mobile and wearable sensors can connect the mechanized and motor-manual components of supply chains, bridging gaps in the connectivity of data. However, there is a shortage of research demonstrating use of location-aware tree and product information that spans multiple machines.

Though the hazards associated with fatalities are well-documented and safe distances from hazards is a common theme in safety education, positional relationships between workers and hazards have not been quantified previously. Using GNSS-RF (Global Navigation Satellite System-Radio Frequency) transponders that allow real-time monitoring of personnel, we collected positioning data for rigging crew workers and three common cable logging hazards: a log loader, skyline carriage, and snag. We summarized distances between all ground workers and each hazard on three active operations and estimated the proportion of time crew occupied higher-risk areas, as represented by geofences. We then assessed the extent to which positioning error associated with different stand conditions affected perceived worker safety status by applying error sampled in a separate, controlled field experiment to the operational data. Root mean squared error was estimated at 11.08 m in mature stands and 3.37 m in clearcuts.

However, the watershed‐level impacts of canopy gap treatment on streamflows are largely unknown. Here, we present the first research that explicitly assesses the impact of canopy gaps on seasonal streamflows and particularly late‐season low flows at the watershed scale. To explicitly model forest–snow interactions in canopy gaps, we made major enhancements to a widely used distributed hydrologic model, distributed hydrology soil vegetation model, with a canopy gap component that represents physical processes of snowpack evolution in the forest gap separately from the surrounding forest on the subgrid scale (within a grid typically 10–150 m). The model predicted snow water equivalent using the enhanced distributed hydrology soil vegetation model showed good agreement (R2 > 0.9) with subhourly snow water equivalent measurements collected from open, forested, and canopy gap sites in Idaho, USA. Compared with the original model that does not account for interactions between gaps and surrounding forest, the enhanced model predicted notably later melt in small‐ to medium‐size canopy gaps (the ratio of gap radius (r) to canopy height (h) ≤ 1.2), and snow melt rates exhibited great sensitivity to changing gap size in medium‐size gaps (0.5 ≤ r/h ≤ 1.2). We demonstrated the watershed‐scale implications of canopy gaps on streamflow in the snow‐dominated Chiwawa watershed, WA, USA. With 24% of the watershed drainage area (about 446 km2) converted to gaps of 60 m diameter, the mean annual 7‐day low flow was increased by 19.4% (i.e., 0.37 m3/s), and the mean monthly 7‐day low flows were increased by 13.5% (i.e., 0.26 m3/s) to 40% (i.e., 1.76 m3/s) from late summer through fall. Lastly, in practical implementation of canopy gaps with the same total gap areas, a greater number of distributed small gaps can have greater potential for longer snow retention than a smaller number of large gaps.",UIEF; Flat Creek; snow-cover dynamics; snowpack; forest-snow interactions; canopy interception; distributed hydrologic model; streamflow impacts; seasonal streamflow; canopy gaps; watershed management,Flat Creek,UIEF; Flat Creek,46.851013,-116.724478,,,,,Wiley,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_wiley_primary_10_1002_hyp_13150_HYP13150,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,,,

Effective reforestation of these species relies on successful seedling establishment, which is affected by planting stock quality, stocktype size, and site preparation techniques. This study examined the effects of container volume (80, 130, 200, and 250 cm(3)) and vegetative competition on seedling survival and physiological and morphological responses for two years, post-outplanting. Glyphosate application (GS) and grass planting (HC) were used to achieve low and high levels of competition. For all measured attributes, the container volume x vegetative competition was not significant. Mortality was strongly influenced by competition, with higher mortality observed for Douglas fir and western larch planted in HC plots one (28% and 98%) and two (61% and 99%) years following outplanting. When competition was controlled, seedlings of both species exhibited greater net photosynthesis (>9 mol m(-2) s(-1)), greater predawn water potential (>-0.35 MPa), and lower mortality (2-3%) following one year in the field, indicating establishment success. The 80 cm(3) stocktype remained significantly smaller and exhibited lower growth rates for the duration of the study, while all other stocktypes were statistically similar.

Plots were established with biomass retention at four levels and with four soil amendment treatments. Fruiting body surveys of woody substrates yielded 1,002 observations over 3 years, comprising 129 mostly basidiomycete species. Community composition of fungal fruiting bodies was significantly influenced by biomass treatments in 2014 (p = 0.003), while there was no significant effect of soil amendment treatments relative to community composition. DNA-based methods, analyzing wood stakes on or within soil, revealed 2,316 different operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of mostly ascomycete species. Fungal community composition within wood stakes as indicated by high-throughput amplicon sequencing was influenced by biomass treatments all 3 years (p < 0.04), while soil amendments were found to significantly influence fungal community composition in 2015 and 2017 (p < 0.04). The two sampling methods revealed different fungal communities. Fruiting body surveys sampled a range of wood substrates and identified important forest pathogens. DNA-based methods produced more data, identified more OTUs (p < 0.001) and were more sensitive to treatments, especially soil amendment treatments. Both methods had advantages and disadvantages, and success with each method depends on the study, the questions being asked, and the researcher’s skills. The potential for biomass harvesting and soil amendments to alter fungal communities in conifer-dominated forests of western North America has implications for forest health and productivity.

Despite the growing number of methods, relatively few have been comparatively assessed using a single benchmark forest inventory validation dataset, limiting their operational application. In this study, we assessed seven ITD methods, representing three common approaches (point-cloud-based, raster-based, hybrid), across coniferous forest stands with diverse structure and composition to understand how ITD and height measurement accuracy vary with method, input parameters and data, and stand density. There was little variability in accuracy between the ITD methods where the average F-score and standard deviation (±SD) were 0.47 ± 0.03 using a lower pulse density ALS dataset with an average of 8 pulses per square meter (ppm2) and 0.50 ± 0.02 using a higher pulse density ALS dataset with an average of 22 ppm2. Using higher ALS pulse density data produced higher ITD accuracies (F-score increase of 10–13%) in some of the methods versus more modest gains in other methods (F-score increase of 1–3%). Omission errors were strongly related with stand density and largely consisted of suppressed trees underneath the dominant canopy. Simple canopy height model (CHM)-based methods that utilized fixed-size local maximum filters had the lowest omission errors for trees across all canopy positions. ITD accuracy had large intra-method variation depending on input parameters; however, the highest accuracies were obtained when parameters such as search window size and spacing thresholds were equal to or less than the average crown diameter of trees in the study area.

ITD accuracy was high in stands with lower canopy cover (recall: 0.67, precision: 0.8) and lower in stands with higher canopy cover (recall: 0.36, precision: 0.67), mainly owing to omission of suppressed trees that were not detected under the dominant tree canopy. Tree species that were well-represented within the study area had high classification accuracies (producer’s/user’s accuracies > ~60%). The similarity between the ALS estimated and observed tree attributes was high, with no statistical difference in the ALS estimated height and DBH distributions and the field observed height and DBH distributions.

However, forest influences on snow accumulation and ablation vary with climate and topography and are therefore subject to temporal and spatial variability. We utilize multiple years of snow observations from across the Pacific Northwest, United States, to assess forest–snow interactions in the relatively warm winter conditions characteristic of maritime and transitional maritime–continental climates. We (a) quantify the difference in snow magnitude and disappearance timing between forests and open areas and (b) assess how forest modifications of snow accumulation and ablation combine to determine whether snow disappears later in the forest or in the open. We find that snow disappearance timing at 12 (out of 14) sites ranges from synchronous in the forest and open to snow persisting up to 13 weeks longer in the open relative to a forested area. By analyzing accumulation and ablation rates up to the day when snow first disappears from the forest, we find that the difference between accumulation rates in the open and forest is larger than the difference between ablation rates. Thus, canopy snow interception and subsequent loss, rather than ablation, set up longer snow duration in the open. However, at two relatively windy sites (hourly average wind speeds up to 8 and 17 m/s), differential snow disappearance timing is reversed: Snow persists 2–5 weeks longer in the forest. At the windiest sites, accumulation rates in the forest and open are similar. Ablation rates are higher in the open, but the difference between ablation rates in the forest and open at these sites is approximately equivalent to the difference at less windy sites. Thus, longer snow retention in the forest at the windiest sites is controlled by depositional differences rather than by reduced ablation rates.

Occupational injury and fatality risks are high for loggers, especially ground crew who work alongside highly mobile hazards like heavy machinery, or work in isolated conditions where injury response may be delayed. Situational awareness may be enhanced with location-sharing (LS) technology that allows users to send GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) coordinates to others, such as coworkers at a jobsite. To evaluate the potential success of LS to improve logging safety, we assessed a) device efficacy and accuracy through operational sampling and a controlled field experiment, and b) logger acceptance and adoption of LS technology through a survey of certified, Idaho loggers. First, using real-time, military-grade LS devices at three active logging operations, we were able to characterize rigging crew positions relative to three operational hazards. Ground crew spend approximately one third of the work day in potentially dangerous areas associated with machinery and equipment and about half of each day near snags. Simulated GNSS error associated with mature stands significantly impacted definitions of safe work distances, however, indicating a need for caution when using LS for proximity awareness, especially under forest canopy. Survey results indicate loggers perceive safety benefits to employing LS devices on logging operations, especially for injury response scenarios, such as alerting coworkers of an emergency and finding injured persons quickly. Loggers indicated intent to adopt safety practices involving location sharing, which is a strong indicator of action according to the Theory of Planned Behavior.

A common approach to support forest-dwelling species in managed forests is to preserve valuable habitat trees. To assess the quality of habitat trees, a hierarchical typology of tree-related microhabitats (TreMs) is applied in the European context for inventory standardization. The first aim of this study was to evaluate whether it is possible to use this hierarchical typology as a standard protocol regardless of location, which is important for potentially standardizing future studies of TreMs, by testing whether the typology could be applied to the western North American mountain forests of Idaho. The second aim of the study was to analyse drivers that influence TreMs in forests of the region. Thirdly, we assessed whether the occurrence of TreMs could be explained by functional groups of trees across the western mountain forests of Idaho and Central European mountain forests, using TreM inventory data previously collected in the Black Forest, Germany. Abundance and richness of TreMs per tree were analyzed as a function of tree species, live status (dead vs. live trees), diameter at breast height (DBH), and site factors (latitude and altitude). Our results show that the TreM typology could be applied with slight modifications in the forests of Idaho. The abundance and richness of TreMs per tree increased with DBH. Snags offered more TreMs per tree than live trees. We were able to group tree species from the two continents in functional groups that were related to the occurrence of certain TreMs. Tree functional groups offer an opportunity to predict the role of certain tree species for habitat provision through TreMs. Combinations of trees from different functional groups could be used to optimize provisioning of TreMs within forest stands.",UIEF; tree-related microhabitats; hierarchal typology; TreM; forest measurement; forest inventory; forest ecology,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_proquest_journals_2471759441,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,,,

E.",2013-01-10,Research Article,"A physically based model built upon extensive field observations of radiation dynamics and snow processes in cold regions forest environments was used to investigate the impacts of prescribed forest gap-thinning treatments on spring snowmelt in a small Saskatchewan River headwater basin of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Both field observations and model simulations showed that snow accumulations in small clear-cut gaps was roughly double those under intact forest cover due to sublimation losses from the canopy. Consequently, mountain forests thinned with small clear-cut gaps resulted in a substantial increase in the magnitude of spring snowmelt. However, the impact of forest thinning on the timing of snowmelt was highly dependent on slope orientation; thinning accelerated snowmelt on south facing slopes primarily through enhanced shortwave radiation, but retarded snowmelt on north facing slopes primarily through reduced incoming longwave radiation. As a result, thinning treatments across opposing north facing and south facing mountain slopes acted to substantially expand the spring melt period in the basin, and illustrated the important hydrological control imparted by intact forest cover through its synchronization of snowmelt across complex terrain. A sensitivity analysis of snowmelt timing to varying spring meteorological conditions strongly suggests that shifts in spring snowmelt runoff from similar forest thinning treatments in mountain regions will depend on the slope and aspect at which they occur in combination with the seasonal timing of snowmelt resulting from latitude-controlled solar elevation effects.",UIEF; gap-thinning; thinning; snowmelt; slope; aspect; snowpack; forest dynamics; cold region forests; watershed management,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,Blackwell Publishing Ltd.,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_proquest_journals_1642081232,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,,,

Previous work has revealed correlations between xylem anatomy to both hydraulic transport capacity and resistance to hydraulic dysfunction. In this study, we compared xylem anatomical and plant functional traits of Pseudotsuga menziesii, Larix occidentalis, and Pinus ponderosa seedlings over the first 10 wk of growth to evaluate potential maximum hydraulic capabilities and resistance to drought‐induced embolism. We hypothesized that, based on key functional traits of the xylem, predicted xylem embolism resistance of the species will reflect their previously determined drought tolerances with L. occidentalis, P. menziesii, and P. ponderosa in order of least to most embolism‐resistant xylem. METHODS: Xylem and pit anatomical characteristics and additional hydraulic‐related functional traits were compared at five times during the first 10 wk of growth using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). KEY RESULTS: Based on thickness to span ratio, torus to pit aperture overlap, and torus thickness, primary xylem appeared to be not only more hydraulically conductive but also less embolism‐resistant than secondary xylem. By week 10, P. menziesii was predicted to have the most embolism‐resistant xylem followed by P. ponderosa and L. occidentalis.

However, complex characteristics of radiation transfer in discontinuous forest gaps make this estimation challenging. This study quantifies net radiation within a forest gap for a range of gap sizes, slopes and aspects, and meteorological conditions. The spatial distribution of net radiation in the gap is found to be heterogeneous with southern and northern areas of the gap receiving minimum and maximum energy amounts, respectively. At a midlatitude site and for completely clear sky conditions in the snow season, results suggest that net radiation in the forest gap is minimum for gaps of size equal to half of the surrounding tree height. In contrast, when sky cloudiness in the snow season is considered, net radiation shows a monotonically increasing trend with gap size. Slope and aspect of forest gap floor also impact the net radiation and its variation with gap size. Net radiation is largest and smallest on steep south‐facing and north‐facing slopes, respectively. Variation of net radiation with slope and aspect is largest for larger gaps. Results also suggest that net radiation in north‐facing forest gaps is larger than in open areas for a longer duration in the snow season than in forest gaps on flat and south‐facing slopes. Since net radiation directly affects melt recharge and evaporation, these findings have implications on forest and water management, wildfire hazard, and forest health.",UIEF; net radiation; forest gap dynamics; forest gap; snow-cover; snowmelt prediction; forested watershed; forest ecology,,UIEF,46.854444,-116.723333,,,,,Blackwell Publishing Ltd.,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_istex_primary_ark_67375_WNG_3CZQ0V93_R,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,,,

Forest soils amended with biochar have potential to sequester carbon (C), improve soil quality, and alter greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions without depleting nutrient stocks. Yet, few studies have examined the effects of biochar on GHG emissions and tree growth in temperate forest soils. We measured GHG emissions, soil C content, and tree growth at managed forest sites in Idaho, Montana, and Oregon. We applied biochar amendments of 0, 2.5, or 25 Mg/ha to the forest soil surface. Flux of carbon dioxide and methane varied by season; however, neither were affected by biochar amendment. Flux of nitrous oxide was not detected at these nitrogen‐limited and unfertilized forest sites. Biochar amendment increased soil C content by 41% but did not affect tree growth. Overall, biochar had no detrimental effects on forest trees or soils. We conclude that biochar can be used harmlessly for climate change mitigation in forests by sequestering C in the soil. Forest soils amended with biochar made from forest residues have potential to modify tree growth, alter greenhouse gas emissions, and enhance long‐term soil carbon storage.

In just over the last one hundred years, methods to suppress and manage wildfire in the United States were formally developed. Wildfire prevention and suppression is necessary to the management of many natural and cultural resources. Cultural resources are nonrenewable resources that require consideration by those who manage wildland fire. Though there has been previous research conducted on the direct impact of fire to cultural resources, there is a dearth of information on how operational effects, such as fireline construction, impact cultural resources including archaeological sites. What limited information is available on the subject suggests that mechanical fireline construction and rehabilitation are no less of a threat to cultural resources than fire is. Working within the framework of experimental archaeology, I simulated an archaeological site using replica precontact artifacts and authentic historic materials. A fireline was mechanically constructed through the simulated site, a prescribed burn was conducted, and the fireline was mechanically rehabilitated. Data were gathered on the spatial displacement and physical impacts to experimental artifacts. The findings of this study reveal that mechanical fireline construction consistently displaces artifacts by several meters. Fireline rehabilitation also contributes to the displacement of artifacts. Both of these operational effects are no less directly threatening to cultural resources than fire is, and have irreversible impacts that severely inhibit the ability to interpret or recover an archaeological site. Physical impacts to artifacts in this study include breakage and staining from combustive residue. By quantifying the impacts of fireline construction and rehabilitation to the simulated archaeological site, this study provides a means for cultural resource specialists and wildland fire managers to make appropriate decisions towards the preservation of our Nation’s heritage.",UIEF; wildfire; wildland fire management; prescribed fire; Rx burn; wildfire suppression; wildfire prevention; experimental archaeology; fireline; fire,Flat Creek,UIEF; Flat Creek,46.851013,-116.724478,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations Publishing,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_proquest_journals_2447253607,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,,,

Understanding of the spatiotemporal radiative regimes in discontinuous forests during the snow season is limited. To improve understanding of radiation dynamics in discontinuous forests, a theoretical, spatially explicit, all‐wave irradiance model was developed. The model was tested using detailed measurements collected with radiometer arrays consisting of 16 pyranometers and 14 pyrgeometers installed in a small forest canopy gap. The model was used to simulate incoming radiation over the snow season at mid‐latitude (47°N), level forest canopy gaps with diameters ranging from one to six times the surrounding tree heights (H). Theoretical results indicate that radiative regimes in small canopy gaps may be distinctly different from continuous open areas and closed‐canopy forests, especially at low solar elevation angles. At low sun angles, spatial radiative minima can occur in gaps due to low incoming shortwave radiation caused by canopy shading, coupled with minimal longwave radiation enhancement from surrounding forests. At 47°N latitude on 1 February, simulated incoming all‐wave radiation in canopy gaps was less than both open and forested areas over 100 to 33% of north‐south transects ranging from 25 to 150 m in 1H to 6H gaps, respectively. By 1 May, the zone of radiative minima in 1H to 6H gaps ranged from 44 to 8%, respectively.

We introduce a new method to obtain stem respired CO₂δ¹³C (δst₋r) with closed equilibrated stem chambers (E-SC). We present a theoretical model describing the equilibration process, test the model against field data and find excellent agreement. The method is further tested by comparing it with closed non-equilibrated stem chambers (NE-SC); we found no difference between these methods. 3.

One major limitation is its inability to detect rapid change; the equilibration process requires 15 ± 2 h. A second limitation is that it cannot be used for species that produce abundant pitch at sites of stem wounding (e.g. Pseudotsuga menziesii). 5.

Conifer resistance to bark beetles involves a three-step response, the first stage of which is resin flow. Rapid resin flow can prevent the colonization of bark beetles within a tree. Fertilization with low levels of N resulted in an increase in resin flow while high levels of N did not significantly increase resin flow in treated trees. Thinning did not result in higher concentrations of foliar K or B but did result in higher concentrations of foliar N and S. The highest concentrations of foliar N and S consistently occurred in the trees from thinned treatments, regardless of fertilization.

Red‐naped sapsucker ecology within aspen (Populus tremuloides) has been well studied, but relatively little is known about red‐naped sapsuckers in conifer forests. We used light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to examine occupancy patterns of red‐naped sapsuckers in a conifer‐dominated system. We surveyed for sapsuckers at 162 sites in northern Idaho, USA, during 2009 and 2010. We used occupancy models and an information‐theoretic approach to model sapsucker occupancy as a function of four LiDAR‐based metrics that characterized vegetation structure and tree harvest, and one non‐LiDAR metric that characterized distance to major roads. We evaluated model support across a range of territory sizes using Akaike's information criterion. Top model support was highest at the 4‐ha extent, which suggested that 4 ha was the most relevant scale describing sapsucker occupancy. Sapsuckers were positively associated with variation of canopy height and harvested area, and negatively associated with shrub and large tree density. These results suggest that harvest regimes and structural diversity of vegetation at moderate extents (e.g., 4 ha) largely influence occurrence of red‐naped sapsuckers in conifer forests. Given the current and projected declines of aspen populations, it will be increasingly important to assess habitat relationships, as well as demographic characteristics, of aspen‐associated species such as red‐naped sapsuckers within conifer‐dominated systems to meet future management and conservation goals. Habitat relationships of red‐naped sapsuckers have been well studied within aspen‐dominated stands, however, little is known in conifer‐dominated forests.

It is critical to improve our understanding about the exchange of carbon dioxide between forest ecosystems and Earth’s atmosphere. Specifically, there is a need for improved mechanistic understanding of the component fluxes of soil respiration (Rs): autotrophic respiration (Ra; roots and associated mycorrhizae) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh; free-living soil microbes and soil fauna involved in decomposition). We examined the responses and relative contributions of these components to manipulated soil moisture. We found that heterotrophic respiration significantly responds to moisture additions regardless of season while autotrophic respiration did not. We also found that widely used and accepted methods for survey measurements (versus automated) were not sufficient to build relationships with abiotic factors for diurnal, monthly, and annual scaling, thus eliminating commonly used gap-filling procedures. Because survey measurements are often used to validate model results, it is critical that they be done over varying time periods (some diurnal) and be paired with automated measurements. When comparing our experimental data to modeled results, we found that DayCent, a daily time-step process-based biogeochemical model, underestimates annual heterotrophic respiration by several magnitudes compared to our temperate mixed conifer forest site. This is likely because DayCent, like most traditional ecosystem models, simulates decomposition through first order kinetics which inadequately represents microbial processes. Recent research has found that including microbial mechanisms explains 20 percent more spatial heterogeneity. We manipulated the DayCent heterotrophic respiration model to include a more mechanistic representation of microbial dynamics and compared the new model with our continuous and survey observations. By using a more representative and fully calibrated model of soil carbon dynamics, we are better able to predict feedbacks between climate and soil carbon pools to inform decisions and provide benefits to society through improvements to ecosystem modeling.",UIEF; global carbon cycle; carbon flux; belowground carbon; forest carbon exchange; soil respiration; forest ecology,,UIEF,46.801,-116.81,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations Publishing,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_proquest_journals_2115821269,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,,,
uief_0179,Impacts of Post-Thinning Biomass Removal and Soil Amendments on Forest Productivity in Northern Idaho,"Sherman, Lauren A.",2017,Dissertation,"A lack of forest management has led to millions acres of overstocked forests in the northwest United States. Thinning forests increases stand resistance to wildfire, pests, and disease. Traditional forest management leaves thinned trees on site as slash. Forest slash provides stable conditions and supplies nutrients to the soil. Biomass removal from thinning can be used for cellulosic biofuel production. Biomass removal can provide environmental, financial, and ecosystem benefits, though biomass removal may decrease forest productivity and disrupt soil biological properties. Soil amendments can be used to mitigate effects of biomass removal by altering soil properties to increase forest productivity. Biochar is an amendment that adds carbon to the soil and increases water-holding capacity, while fertilizer can improve forest production and replace nutrients removed in biomass. This thesis examines the effect of post-thinning biomass retention levels on forest growth, as well as responses to fertilizer and biochar soil amendments.",UIEF; biomass removal; thinning; soil amendment treatments; forest management; fertilizer; biochar; forest ecology,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations Publishing,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_proquest_journals_1927697519,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,,,

Feedstock removal has the potential to benefit forest health and provide ecosystem services, while also generating profit for landowners, contractors and forest managers. However, many landowners are faced with the challenge of managing forest residuals to meet slash compliances and fire regulations. Currently, most residuals are burned or left on site to decompose. Every year, the north-central Idaho region produces over 16 million dry tons of unutilized forest residues. In a time where alternative energy sources are growing in demand, new approaches to utilize these residuals for bioenergy production are being examined. One approach is a portable, small-scale wood pellet mill that can be taken directly to the logging site. Utilizing forest residues for pellet production reduces residue burning and its potential negative impacts on air quality.

The goal of this study is to project the effect of typical forest management actions on forest C levels, given a changing climate, in the Moscow Mountain area of north-central Idaho, USA. Harvest and prescribed fire management treatments followed by plantings of one of four regionally important commercial tree species were simulated, using the climate-sensitive version of the Forest Vegetation Simulator, to estimate the biomass of four different planted species and their C sequestration response to three climate change scenarios. Results show that anticipated climate change induces a substantial decrease in C sequestration potential regardless of which of the four tree species tested are planted. It was also found that Pinus monticola has the highest capacity to sequester C by 2110, followed by Pinus ponderosa , then Pseudotsuga menziesii , and lastly Larix occidentalis.

Gross photosynthesis increased with increasing intensity of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to > 2000 μmol m-2 s-1 and with increasing bark surface temperature from 15 to > 45 ⚬C. Maximum observed refixation rates were 76 ± 3% (mean ± SE) of dark respiration. At a given temperature and irradiance, dark respiration rate was the physiological parameter that correlated most strongly with gross photosynthesis (R = 0.89, P < 0.0001, n = 43). Dark respiration rates varied 20-fold among branches. Over this range, refixation averaged 55 ± 2% of dark respiration at 25 ⚬C and 1000 μmol PAR m-2 s-1.

uief_0184,From the Laboratory to the Field: Investigating the Effect of Biochar on Forest Insects,"Rice, Stacey Lee",2022-08,Dissertation,"Insects provide numerous ecosystem services in a forest environment, such as pollination, nutrient cycling, as well as providing disturbance. Defoliating lepidoptera such as Douglas-fir tussock moth (Orgyia pseudotsugata Lepidoptera: Erebidae) attack healthy trees, predominantly true firs (Abies sp.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), and spruce (Picea sp.), and convert tree foliar biomass into frass, contributing soil organic matter within the forest ecosystem that benefit soil organisms. In outbreak years, high densities of O. pseudotsugata may consume all available foliage. Defoliation of large forest stands allows for light to penetrate to the undergrowth and accelerate the regenerative succession of the forest stand. Wood boring insects including bark beetles help to cycle nutrients by increasing the rate of breakdown of woody material which also contributes to accumulation of soil organic matter. Biochar is a carbon-rich material made via thermochemical decomposition of organic matter in a high temperature, low oxygen environment. Biochar can be created from many types of organic material such as discarded slash material during logging of overstocked stands or beetle killed trees, and used as a soil amendment to restore degraded soils. Biochar has been used to sequester carbon, and to increase soil water holding capacity and plant available water. Forest insects may be exposed to biochar when the material is applied to surface organic horizons and downed trees. The results of recent laboratory studies show a potential negative effect on insects exposed to biochar material, although field experiments are necessary to establish how insects are affected by the application of biochar in a forest system. In the first experiment, direct exposure of O. pseudotsugata to biochar either on the surface of or incorporated within synthetic diet negatively affected survival and weight gain of the insects. Although the physiological effects of biochar are unknown, the low 10% volume/volume biochar treatment potentially may lead to compensatory feeding by the insects. Two field experiments were performed using sections (bolts) of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson), to determine if biochar applied to the bark surface (1) interfered with attack or emergence of the pine engraver beetle Ips pini (Say) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) when bolts were baited with a pheromone lure, or (2) altered species richness or abundance of insect assemblages on non-baited bolts. Similar mean density of nuptial chambers and emergence indicated both control and biochar treated bolts were suitable habitat for I. pini. Species richness was greater in the non-treated control bolts compared to the bolts treated with biochar for emerged insects in the test that compared bolts that did not receive a pheromone treatment. Red turpentine beetles, Dendroctonous valens (LeConte) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) were more abundant in non-treated control bolts as compared with the biochar treated bolts. Colonization by other insect taxa were not found to be significantly different between non-treated control bolts and bolts treated with biochar, although the insects that emerged from each bolt varied.",UIEF; biochar; forest insects; forest ecology; defoliation; forest canopy gaps; carbon sequestration; forest entomology,West Hatter Creek,UIEF; West Hatter Creek,46.83675,-116.863583,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations Publishing,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_proquest_journals_2712893373,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,,,

uief_0186,Volatile Pheromones and Community Structure of the Cerambycidae (Insecta: Coleoptera) in Western Idaho,"Lyons-Yerion, Claudia D.",2021-05,Dissertation,"Research over the last 15 years has revealed widespread parsimony of a number of highly conserved pheromone motifs within the Cerambycidae (Insecta: Coleoptera). These conserved pheromones have been exploited to develop synthetic volatile pheromone lures, which has led to the emergence of pheromone-baited trapping as a valuable tool to capture and study cerambycids. We used pheromone-baited traps in 2014 to 2016, including traps baited with conserved pheromone motifs, to collect field data in western Idaho to address existing knowledge gaps in pheromone-based interactions and community ecology of cerambycids in the Pacific Northwest and Intermountain Region of the United States. Our overall objective was to utilize pheromone-baited trapping to examine the species composition, richness, diversity, evenness and community dynamics within and among cerambycid assemblages at sites in western Idaho and to examine the possible role of volatile pheromones in these parameters. Our trapping bioassays captured two species, Centrodera dayi Leech (Lepturinae: Rhagiini) and Phymatodes (Phymatodes) vulneratus (LeConte) (Cerambycinae: Callidiini) that represented new state records for Idaho. Analysis of headspace volatiles collected from captured beetles demonstrated (R)-2-methylbutan-1-ol to be a male-produced volatile pheromone for Phymatodes dimidiatus (Kirby). Our trapping results indicated that flight periods overlapped for P. dimidiatus, Phymatodes hirtellus (LeConte), Phymatodes nitidus LeConte and P. (P.) vulneratus (LeConte) (Cerambycinae: Callidiini) for sites and years combined, while flight periods of the sympatric species P. dimidiatus, P. hirtellus and P. nitidus also overlapped at the same site and year. Given this overlap in flight periods, these species may be utilizing other biological and/or behavioral mechanisms to ensure reproductive isolation. Our trapping results suggested a regional split between populations of Tragosoma harrisii LeConte and T. soror Laplante (Prioninae: Meroscelisini) within Idaho, with T. harrisii captured in higher numbers in the northern portion and T. soror captured in higher numbers in the southern portion of the region sampled. The flight periods of T. harrisii and T. soror overlapped at all site-year replicates where both species were captured, suggesting that flight period phenology was not being used as a mechanism to maintain reproductive isolation between these species. A likely mechanism is the utilization of opposite enantiomers of the (2,3)-hexanediol pheromone structure. Additional analyses testing attraction among 13 synthetic volatile pheromone lures found a significant treatment effect for nine cerambycid species. Likely attractants for two of the species were racemic 3-hydroxyoctan-2-one for Clytus planifrons (LeConte) (Cerambycinae: Clytini), and racemic 2-methylbutan-1-ol for Xylocrius agassizi (LeConte) (Cerambycinae: Callidiini). The results for our cerambycid community analysis comparing the Shannon diversity index (H’), species richness (S’) and the Shannon evenness (J’) index found that all three measures differed among site-years, while the analyses for species richness, diversity and evenness of cerambycid captures among pheromone treatments across all site-years showed a significant difference among treatments only for species evenness. We describe a method to develop a region-specific, multi-component pheromone lure that maximizes the capture of total cerambycid species, which can also target individual species of interest. Such a method could produce a cost-effective lure to monitor cerambycid communities and potential invasive and/or rare or endangered species in western Idaho and other regions.",UIEF; pheromones; pheromone trapping; pheromone lures; Cerambycidae; entomology; bait trapping; pheromone baiting; forest entomology,,UIEF,46.858483,-116.72425,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations Publishing,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_proquest_journals_2544058525,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,,,

Sequential sampling has been broadly applied in the inventory of ecological resources. Using case studies and simulations, we demonstrate that estimates of the population mean that are derived from sequential sampling can be overconfident if the population is autocorrelated, that is, that the confidence intervals are too short. We test a model-based correction designed to ameliorate this effect of autocorrelation upon the estimates of confidence intervals from sequential sampling. The correction is useful in realistic situations. Among the scenarios we tested, better confidence interval coverage was achieved with larger sample sizes, and coverage rates were poor at smaller sample sizes. Nominal coverage could be attained even when the wrong model was used, although only at the cost of requiring a much higher average sample size. Synthesis and applications. If sequential sampling is naively applied in a population that has autocorrelation, then confidence intervals for population parameters will be too short, and the usefulness of the sample will be overestimated.

uief_0192,"Improved Assessments of Ecosystem Services through Active-Remote Sensing: Quantification of Timber and Snow Resources","Tinkham, Wade T.",2013-05,Dissertation,"Over the last century the natural environment has experienced an accelerated rate of climatic change in terms of both temperature and precipitation. The call for remote sensing methodologies that can provide reliable and accurate estimates of ecosystem services has never been stronger. This need is vital for assessing resources like above ground carbon stocks and water availability (from snow) as these resources have already been shown to be influenced by our changing climate. Although LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is still a relatively young technology, only moving into mainstream use in the mid 1980's, it has since become the most promising remote sensing technique for high resolution elevation measurements in rugged and remote landscapes. Progressing our understanding of LiDAR error structure spatially, resulting from the interactions of vegetation and terrain, will allow us to generate more reliable assessments of carbon and water stocks in remote mountainous regions. The research within this dissertation is focused on improving the assessment of ecosystem services, by advancing our understanding of LiDAR-derived DEM vertical error and applying that knowledge to quantify the accuracy of associated value-added products. The work first evaluates the performance of two open-source and one commercial black-box LiDAR classification algorithms and identifies their sources of error in diverse landscapes. This showed that across algorithm there was no statistical difference, but that orders of magnitude differences could be found between different terrain and cover types. This demonstrated that LiDAR-derived DEM vertical error has little impact (<3% of timber volume) on derived forest metrics. These principals are then deployed in the development of LiDAR-aware allometrics for Abies grandis stem volume and biomass. Taking advantage of LiDAR's ability to measure tree height, it was shown that height based allometrics are as reliably accurate as traditional diameter-at-breast height equations. This project is intended as a proof of concept, meant to show how LiDAR data could be used operationally within forest management to directly estimate ecosystem services, including above ground carbon and stem volume. The same principals are then taken to the landscape scale and applied to spatially predict LiDAR-derived DEM vertical error through coupling Random Forest with intensive field surveying. The Random Forest produced model provided a representative, yet conservative, estimate of the DEM vertical error, on average predicted errors 10% greater than those seen in through field surveying. This methodology can be applied to any LiDAR-derived value-added product that is dependent on the creation of an accurate DEM (i.e. canopy height models, snow depth). The final object demonstrates the use of the predictive error methodology to a LiDAR-derived snow depth map. The model predicted errors deviated from the field measured errors with a RMSE of 0.09-0.34 m across the different cover types. The work highlighted the importance of snow drifting in semi-arid environments, with 30% of the catchment snow depositing in 10% of the area. This body of work; 1) improves the understanding of how vegetation and terrain influence the fine scale accuracy of LiDAR-derived DEMs; 2) demonstrates the minimal impact that LiDAR DEM errors have on LiDAR estimates of timber volume; 3) enhances the use of LiDAR in operational forestry by demonstrating the use of LiDAR-aware allometrics in the estimation of timber biomass and volume; 4) develops a method of predicting LiDAR-derived DEM vertical error at extended scales (e.g., catchments) through the use of Random Forest; and 5) provides a quantitative understanding of the spatial variability of error in a LiDAR-derived value-added product (snow depth), by apply the Random Forest methodology to a snow-on/off LiDAR acquisition.",UIEF; remote sensing; LiDAR; ecosystem services; forest management; forest operations; forest products,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations Publishing,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_proquest_journals_1432606867,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,,,

Our objective was to determine whether N from fertilized agriculture enters northern Idaho forest edges and significantly impacts their N status. We stratified 27 forest edge sampling sites by the N fertilization history of the adjacent land: current, historical, and never. We measured N stable isotopes (δ¹⁵N), N concentration (%N), and carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratios of conifer tree and deciduous shrub foliage, shrub roots, and bulk soil, as well as soil available N. Conifer foliage δ¹⁵N and %N, shrub root δ¹⁵N, and bulk soil N were greater and soil C/N ratios lower (P < 0.05) at forest edges than interiors, regardless of adjacent fertilization history. For shrub foliage and bulk soil δ¹⁵N, shrub root %N and C/N ratios, and soil nitrate, significant edge-interior differences were limited to forests bordering lands that had been fertilized currently or historically. Foliage and soil δ¹⁵N were most enriched at forest edges bordering currently fertilized agriculture, suggesting that these forests are receiving N fertilizer inputs. Shrub root %N was greater at forest edges bordering currently fertilized agriculture than at those bordering grasslands that had never been fertilized (P = 0.01). Elevated N at forest edges may increase vegetation growth, as well as susceptibility to disease and insects. The higher N we found at forest edges bordering agriculture may also be found elsewhere, given similar agricultural practices in other regions and the prevalence of forest fragmentation.",UIEF; forest edge; edge trees; fertilization; nitrogen; root nitrogen; soil nitrogen; forest ecology,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,Springer-Verlag,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_fao_agris_US201300790864,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,,,

Compared to the controls, the 5 and15 g/seedling of FR or ME fertilizer produced significantly greater caliper growth and the 5 and 15 g/seedling of ME fertilizer and 15 and 30 g of FR fertilizer produced significantly greater height growth after 3 yr. Mortality occurred mainly during the first growing season and varied substantially with fertilizer types and dosage. High dosage (30 g/seedling) generally caused more mortality than other dosage levels. Seventy-eight, 54, 51, and 36% of total nutrients had been released from the FR, MR, SR and ME products, respectively, by late August of the first growing season. Early in the second growing season, the FR product had released 98% of its total nutrients, and the MR, SR, and ME products had released over 90% of their nutrients. The best fertilizer treatment, 15 g of the ME product, produced a 21% diameter increase and a 30% height increase 3 yr after treatment.

uief_0195,Development of a Spatial Severity Model for the Quantification of Wildland Fire Effects in Coniferous Forests,"Sparks, Aaron M.",2017-05,Dissertation,"Fire is an integral change agent in the Earth system and plays key roles in nutrient cycling, plant species distribution, atmospheric composition and ecosystem service function at temporal scales ranging from years to centuries and spatial scales ranging from micro to continental. Increased fire activity (intensity, frequency, and size) in North American forested ecosystems has been observed and predicted under warmer and drier climate conditions. As forested ecosystems serve as significant carbon sinks, there is an urgent need to improve our understanding of fire intensity impacts on forest productivity and recovery post-fire. The research within this dissertation is focused on advancing our current understanding by identifying mechanistic relationships between fire intensity and post-fire tree response (e.g. mortality, physiology, growth and vulnerability) that enable spatiotemporal characterization of fire effects. This research tested the hypothesis that increasing quantities, or ‘doses’, of fire intensity lead to predictable responses in terms of tree mortality or physiological function. This hypothesis was first tested using nursery grown Pinus contorta and Larix occidentalis seedlings subjected to highly controlled laboratory surface fires. A dose-response relationship was demonstrated between fire radiative energy and post-fire seedling mortality and physiological function. Additionally, this relationship was shown to be detectable using spectral indices common to plant physiology research. The dose-response hypothesis was further tested at the mature tree scale by using prescribed fires in mature Pinus ponderosa forest stands. Increasing levels of peak fire radiative power were observed to lead to reduced post-fire radial growth. Permanent defense structures, axial resin ducts, were found to increase in density, size, and area per growth ring post-fire regardless of fire intensity. Finally, observations from satellite based remote sensing were used to test the dose-response hypothesis at the landscape spatial scale. Similar to observations at the tree scale, satellite measures of forest productivity decreased with increasing fire radiative power. Species composition was demonstrated to influence the magnitude of productivity loss post-fire. Ultimately, the work in this dissertation demonstrates a framework to spatially characterize individual tree and forest condition post-fire, improving our understanding of the carbon cycle and ability to sustainably manage forests.",UIEF; fire behavior; fire severity; forest response; carbon sinks; fuel; forest fuels; fire radiative energy; seedling response; fire resistance; fire adaptations; fire,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations Publishing,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_proquest_journals_1925343119,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,,,

Removal of woody residue after harvesting can reduce litter decomposition rates by altering physical conditions of forest surface and N input. Thus, I studied the effects of biomass (a.k.a residue) retention levels from thinning forests on changes in site physical conditions (e.g., temperature and moisture) and changes in litter decomposition and nutrients dynamics. In addition, I examined the compensating effect of fertilizer N additions. Decomposition was measured using a 172-day litterbag experiment in two forest stands which were thinned in 2013 and fertilized in 2014. Woody residue retention levels were: normal (1x), doubled (2x), or removed (0x), and there were adjacent unthinned control plots. The litterbags were placed on the forest floor in 2016. The 0x retention level had litterbags with the lowest moisture and respiration, but the highest decomposition rate (k) and mass loss as compared to the control. Litterbag nitrogen (N) had the greatest losses in the 0x retention plots. There was no evidence that fertilization increased litterbag decomposition rates. This litterbag study indicates that removal woody residues from conifer forests in northern Idaho will not alter litterbag decomposition rates.",UIEF; biofuel; bioenergy; forest litter; woody residues; soil productivity; site sustainability; site quality; biomass retention; nitrogen fertilization; forest ecology,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations Publishing,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_proquest_journals_2115844480,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,,,

Limitations occur in the transportation and handling of the high carbon material as biochar is in particulate form and has low bulk density. Attempts to overcome these challenges led to an increasing interest into the biomass densification technologies such as pelletization and briquetting, the present study investigated the consolidation mechanism of biochar and Douglas fir slash (stem and leaf materials) during pelletization from several aspects. The single pelleter unit was utilized to perform the compaction and extrusion tests on biochar and Douglas fir slash grinds, Analysis of variance showed that biochar had a significant effect (P<0.05) on both of the compaction and extrusion energy consumption, which increased with higher biochar content. Process temperature significantly influenced the compaction energy consumption, which increased with higher temperature in the range from 80 to 140°C. Results also showed that stem and leaf materials had a significant influences on the compaction process but minimal influences on the extrusion process. To understand how the friction between the biomass particles and the die surface wall behaves during the compression, an external load cell was set up at the bottom of the single pelleter unit to measure the die wall friction during compaction. Results showed that biochar consumed a higher frictional energy followed by stem and leaf materials during the compaction process, findings also showed that the compression behavior of the binary and ternary mixtures is acted as the intermediate materials between those plain mixture components. The pressure and relative density derived from compression curves were then incorporated into several widely used compaction models. Results demonstrated that Kawakita provides the best fitting for both of the sinlge components and binary mixtures, the model constants showed that biochar compact had the highest failure strength. The fourth study compared the specific energy consumption of biomass pelletization between the single pelleter unit and industrial pellet mill, the influences of the binder and lubricant addition on the pellet output and durability were also examined.",UIEF; biochar; pyrolysis; soil quality; water conservation; carbon sequestration; pelletization; compaction; forest products,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations Publishing,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_proquest_journals_1844577915,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,,,

uief_0200,Functional Significance of Endophyte Communities from a Conifer Forest,"Ridout, Mary E.",2014-08,Dissertation,"The microbiome of the conifer forest may be functionally significant in forest hosts, the forest itself, and in agricultural fields converted from forests and woodlands. To assess functional significance of the forest microbiome, we examined within-microbiome interactions, interactions of microbiomes with the host, and the effects of microbiome-host interactions in both natural and managed systems. To determine the effects of within-microbiome interactions on Dothistroma needle blight in Pinus ponderosa, we inoculated non-pathogenic endophytes from P. ponderosa into emerging needles of Dothistroma-infected trees. Four of six endophytes enabled the pathogen by increasing disease severity as much as 4.7% while one endophyte antagonized the pathogen, reducing severity of the disease by 7%, indicating the potential of non-pathogens interact with pathogens within the microbiome. We then examined the potential function of the microbiome of Pinus ponderosa in conspecific recruitment by inoculating P. ponderosa seed with endophytes of mature conspecifics prior to germination. Endophytes from P. ponderosa reduced germination and emergence of conspecific seed. A needle endophyte showed the strongest inhibitory effects, reducing emergence by as much as 67% indicating foliar endophytes in the litter microbiome may contribute to beta diversity of conifer forests. Finally, to determine whether the conifer microbiome might be significant to the success of winter wheat production in converted woodlands, we conducted a series of experiments to study the potential of the microbiome to mediate disease resistance and stress tolerance in hard red winter wheat. The whole microbiome of pine litter was most effective for suppression of Fusarium culmorum, reducing plant mortality and increasing biomass of Fusarium-infected plants by over 67% compared to untreated plants. Forest endophytes significantly increased root development during vernalization of wheat seedlings. A root endophyte from the microbiome of Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca doubled the yield of Fusarium-infected wheat subjected to water stress, indicating that the microbiome of the pine woodlands may have facilitated the success of dryland wheat production in the Pacific Northwest, USA.

The GAP land-cover designations are based on satellite-derived data, and although these data are widely available, these data do not capture the 3-dimensional vegetation architecture that may be important in describing vertebrate distributions. To date, no studies have examined how the inclusion of snag-or shrub-specific Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data might influence GAP model performance. The objectives of this paper were 1) to assess the performance of the National GAP models and Northwest GAP models with independently collected field data, and 2) to assess whether the inclusion of 3-dimensional vegetation data from LiDAR improved the performance of National GAP and Northwest GAP models. We included only two parameters from the LiDAR data: presence or absence of shrubs and presence or absence of snags >= 25 cm diameter at breast height. We surveyed for birds at >150 points in a 20,000-ha coniferous forest in northern Idaho and used data for eight shrub-and cavity-nesting species for validation purposes. On a guild level, National GAP models performed only marginally better than Northwest GAP models in correct classification rate, and LiDAR data did not improve vertebrate distribution models. At the scale used in this study, GAP models had poor predictive power and this is important for managers interested in using GAP models for species distributions at scales similar to ours, such as a small park or preserve,200 km(2) in size. Additionally, because the inclusion of LiDAR data did not consistently affect the performance of GAP models, future studies might consider whether LiDAR data affect GAP model performance by examining 1) different spatial scales, 2) different LiDAR metrics, and/or 3) species-specific habitat relationships not currently available in GAP models.",UIEF; USGS; GAP; gap analysis problem; conservation gaps; LiDAR; land cover; land use; conservation management; GIS,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,US Fish and Wildlife Service,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_gale_incontextgauss_ISR_A464054445,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,,,

This demand has put a pressure on the wood industry to develop more sustainable strategies to improve yields and wood quality. One possible way to address this goal is a genetic modification of Douglas-fir creating faster to grow, pathogen resistant and most importantly with improved wood quality tree line. To achieve such an aim is to first characterize all involved molecular pathways and future modification targets. This can be especially difficult in case of a non-modal organism such as Douglas-fir. Without organism genome sequenced, another approach used in this tape of studies in a direct investigation of involved proteins my means of mass spectrometry. Comparative analysis of proteome of wood fibers, at different developmental stages, can be used to get an insight into the mechanism behind wood formation. Methods: In order to study wood fiber formation process in Douglas-fir an in-vitro model system was employed. In this approach, differentiation processes were monitored by tracking wood fiber cell wall development (primary to secondary cell wall) using polarized microscopy imaging. To analyze proteins expressed at various stages of in-vitro tracheids formation several methods of protein extraction, purification and separation were investigated and a phenol-based approach was selected for subsequent studies.

uief_0203,Modeling Landscape Change and Evaluating Ecological Effects of Landscape Composition and Configuration in Northern Idaho,"Pocewicz, Amy Lynne",2006-11,Dissertation,"Future landscape changes in two northern Idaho counties were projected using a unique agent-based model based on private landowner decisions, and the ecological impact of land uses and their configuration was measured via forest nitrogen (N) dynamics and butterfly densities. The agent-based model resulted in landscape projections within range of those based on historical trends and was less affected by errors in image classification. This model was also adjusted to reflect the effects of two alternative policy scenarios on enrollment in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and forest thinning. While policies oriented toward increasing enrollment in the CRP resulted in a significant increase in CRP lands, policies targeting increased forest thinning on private non-industrial lands had little effect. Forest edges bordering agricultural fields appeared to receive N fertilizer inputs, which may increase tree growth or susceptibility to insects and disease. In 27 forest edge sampling sites stratified by adjacent N fertilization history, I found that conifer foliage nitrogen stable isotopes (δ15N) and percent nitrogen (%N), shrub root δ15N, and bulk soil N were greater and soil carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratios lower at forest edges than interiors, regardless of adjacent fertilization history. For shrub foliage and bulk soil δ15N, shrub root %N and C/N ratios, and soil nitrate, significant edge-interior differences were limited to forests bordering lands that had been fertilized currently or historically. Shrub root %N was greater at forest edges bordering agriculture than at those bordering never-fertilized grasslands. The number of butterfly species, community-level density, and densities of most groupings of butterflies were negatively correlated with tree canopy cover and positively correlated with nectar plant cover. Only lycaenid density was positively correlated with host plant cover. We found a negative correlation between Celastrina echo adult density and that of its host plant foliar %N. When represented at a landscape scale, nectar resources were only positively correlated with the density of large, flower-nectaring, polyphagous butterflies, suggesting that large butterflies are better able to disperse in search of preferred resources.

Amphibians are currently the most imperiled of all vertebrate taxa and are often considered good indicators of ecosystem function because of their vulnerability to habitat degradation Despite this, several native amphibian species currently persist in the highly modified Palouse Prairie ecoregion of North America. We modeled the landscape associations of the most common of these species at a home range and population connectivity scale, predicted how this landscape is likely to change in the future, and assessed what the impacts of those changes would be on the persistence of these amphibian populations. First, we developed a novel survey-based method for predicting landscape change, compared it to a standard trend-based model, and found that rural housing units were predicted to increase by 31%, forests to decrease by 11%, agricultural lands by 7%, and grasslands by 4% over the following decade. We then developed habitat models for Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris), Pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla), and long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) which indicated that forest practices will likely to be detrimental to long-toed salamanders and beneficial to Pacific treefrogs, and that Columbia spotted frogs had a high level of vulnerability to predicted development patterns. Next, we used an empirical example from this area to show how removing full siblings from larval population genetic could reduce bias. Finally, we used a comparative landscape genetic approach to model the connectivity of Columbia spotted frogs and long-toed salamanders. For both species, urban and rural developed land cover provided the highest landscape resistances. Resistance values for long-toed salamanders followed a moisture gradient, with forest providing the lowest resistance. For Columbia spotted frogs, however, agriculture provided the least resistance, with grassland and forest associated with much higher resistance values. These results emphasize the need for species-specific data to inform management and conservation planning, and also contribute to a growing body of work on the landscape associations and multiple dispersal strategies of pond-breeding amphibians globally.",UIEF; landscape change; land cover change; amphibians; habitat loss; climate change; ecosystem dynamics; indicator species; wildlife,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations Publishing,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_proquest_journals_304894936,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,,,

I focus on these issues in three case-study areas of northern Idaho and northeastern Oregon. I use a mixed methodology that combines statistical modeling of survey-based questionnaire data, a social attribute mapping exercise for mapping values on large landscapes, and geographic information systems simulation modeling. These methods are employed to develop a better understanding of the nature of the land use changes occurring; to quantify the impacts of sociodemographic changes on beliefs about land use, resource management, and people's psychological relationship with place; and to compare the empirical structure of values for the landscape reported in a mapping exercise to theories of environmental values. Through the results of four independent research articles, I show that my case-study areas are changing rapidly both on the landscape and socially. Residential development is increasing rapidly and appears likely to continue to do so. While this growth brings about a change in the psychological relationship people have with places, growth doesn't appear to spur new types of conflicts over land use and resource management. Instead sociodemographic change and population growth are more likely to bring new voices to the diversity of existing beliefs about land use and resource management. Finally, I find that although the population of a place may be changing rapidly, that the landscape reflects a wide diversity of values for people, that there is a large degree of overlap in these values, and that structurally they reflect landscapes that provide both material (social/economic) and postmaterial (personal/environmental) qualities. The four articles reflect on the complexity of social and ecological interactions. The findings are presented in the context of case studies. The relatively consistent patterns among the three diverse case-study areas indicate that future studies that employ experimental designs may find similar results and have more generalizability. The four articles are supported by a series of appendices that include research instruments and descriptive results not presented elsewhere.",UIEF; land use; land use change; natural resource management; sociodemographic change; landscape effects; development; forest ecology,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations Publishing,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/1km8i79/cdi_proquest_journals_304855341,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,,,

The charter of the Northen Alliance states that its purpose is: …to expand cooperation, improve coordination, and further interdisciplinary participation of natural resource scientists, educators, and managers working in partnership to address changes in natural resource priorities. The Alliance will address natural resource situations in the northern Rocky Mountains to identify potential and appropriate management strategies and will develop coordinated research and education programs to support these strategies. A variety of cooperative ventures are anticipated to result from the additional and more intensive cooperation under the Alliance partnership. This compendium—one of the cooperative ventures—responds to information needs expressed by these educators, researchers, and natural resource managers. The increasing emphasis on holistic management of the complex ecosystems in the Northern Rocky Mountains makes it imperative that information developed on the various experimental areas be made readily available. The compendium provides an overview of areas with a rich array of research results and key contacts for ecosystem management learning experiences. The Alliance recognized that no one person or organization has the breadth and depth to provide all the answers for managing these complex and widely diversified ecosystems. The Alliance also recognized that there is a wealth of scientific data and management experience that is too often unknown or not fully recognized for its importance. The most obvious sources of information are the formally established experimental forests, ranges, and watersheds. Information has accumulated from these U.S. Forest Service and university-sponsored experimental areas for much of this century and is available through publications, on-the-ground demonstrations, and other sources such as displays, brochures, videos, and computer programs. Unfortunately, the who, what, when, and where for these experimental areas are not always well known to many who could use the information in their resource management planning, their search for scientific information, their educational pursuits, and their need for “just show me what happens.” The Northern Alliance realized this and saw this compendium as a valuable tool in the development of the Learning Center concept. Learning Centers are an evolving concept in cooperatively gathering and synthesizing information needed for implementing ecosystem management. Long-term ecological research is key to the development of this concept. Experimental areas provide just such needed basic biological and physical science information. Interpretation of this research in the context of current social and economic concerns will establish a scientific focal point of Learning Centers.",UIEF; USFS; USDA; compendium; UIEF general information; USDA,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,United States Forest Service,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,https://www.fs.usda.gov/rm/pubs_int/int_gtr334.pdf#page=67,,

These insectivorous species prey on pests that would otherwise invade agricultural crops and spread disease. Despite their vital role and impending threats to their survival, such as white nosed syndrome and climate change, these bats have received little attention in northern Idaho. This data deficiency impedes conservation decision-making that would protect these bats. My research seeks to address this deficiency using a non-invasive technique with acoustic monitors which capture the echolocation calls of foraging bats. I have set up sixteen monitors in the four main units of the University of Idaho Experimental Forest near Princeton, Idaho which will collect data from late May to early August in 2022. The monitors were strategically placed across the three bat habitat classifications of open, edge, and narrow to maximize the detectability of multiple species. The main objective of this study is to create a species inventory for the Experimental Forest, as well as conduct seasonal and temporal analyses of foraging activity. The recordings collected by the AudioMoth monitors are processed by the software Kaleidoscope Pro for an automatic species identification, which will be manually verified after all data collection is complete. As of June 17th, eleven species have been detected from over five hundred recordings collected. The monitors will be removed in early August and then data will be analyzed in more detail.",UIEF; bats; climate change; wildlife conservation; species inventory; AudioMoth; Kaleidoscope Pro; species identification; wildlife,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,,Fish and Wildlife Sciences,,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,https://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/icur/2022/poster_session/20/,,

uief_0213,Towards Improved Quantification and Prediction of Post-Fire Recovery in Conifers: Expanding Laboratory Fire Radiative Energy-Tree Physiology Experiments to a Mature Forest Stand,"Kolden, Crystal; Sparks, Aaron",2018-05,Research Report,"Current assessments of the ecological impacts of fires, termed burn severity, investigate the degree to which an ecosystem has changed due to a fire and typically encompass both vegetation and soil effects. Burn severity assessments at local to regional scales are typically achieved using spectral indices (such as the differenced normalized burn ratio and the Relativized differenced Normalized Burn Ratio) derived from satellite remote sensing data before and following the fires. Although considerable efforts have been made to quantify post-fire burn severity across large spatial extents through spectral data, the explicit physiological link between fire behavior, tree mortality, and spectral reflectance is lacking, and inhibits prediction and quantification of tree mortality and recovery post-fire. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of linking fire behavior to plant ecophysiology as an improved route to characterizing severity, but research to date has been limited to laboratory-scale investigations. In this study, fire behavior was quantified at the tree- and landscape-scale and compared with post-fire growth, defenses, and productivity. Results show a clear dose-response relationship between peak fire radiative flux density (FRFD: W m-2 ) and post-fire ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) radial growth. Increasing levels of peak fire radiative power resulted in reduced post-fire radial growth. Permanent defense structures (axial resin ducts) were found to increase in density, size, and area per growth ring post-fire regardless of fire intensity. Satellite-based remote sensing observations of coniferous forests in the northwest United States were used to test the dose-response hypothesis at the landscape spatial scale. Similar to observations at the tree scale, satellite measures of forest productivity decreased with increasing fire radiative power. Species composition was demonstrated to influence the magnitude of productivity loss post-fire. Ultimately, this work provides critical first steps in building a framework to spatially characterize individual tree and forest condition post-fire, improving our understanding of the carbon cycle and ability to sustainably manage forests.",UIEF; fire; burn severity; fire experiemtns; fire quantification; fire prediction; spectral reflectance; burn severity; fire,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,Unsure of publisher,,record,https://www.firescience.gov/projects/16-2-01-9/project/16-2-01-9_final_report.pdf,,

One would think that the burden of proof should rest with the model, to force it to show that it can make accurate predictions. Further, one would think that increasing the sample size ought to increase the model's ability to demonstrate its utility. Traditional statistical tools are inappropriate for this because they default to the case that the model and the data are no different, and their ability to detect differences increases with the sample size. These traditional tools are optimized to detect differences, rather than similarities. We present an alternative strategy for model validation that is based on regression and statistical tests of equivalence. Equivalence tests reverse the usual null hypothesis: they posit that the populations being compared are different and use the data to prove otherwise. In this sense, equivalence tests are lumping tests, whereas the traditional statistical tests are splitting tests. To date, model validation with equivalence tests has focused on comparisons of means. Our proposed test checks not only for similarity of means, but also for similarity between individual predictions and observations. The strategy is demonstrated using three case studies that differ in their modeling objectives, and for varied sample sizes. The proposed strategy provides a formal means of model validation that is superior to traditional statistical tests in each case.",UIEF; Flat Creek; tree physiology; model validation; equivalence test; model credibility; forest operations,Flat Creek,UIEF; Flat Creek,46.851013,-116.724478,,,,,Heron Publishing,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,https://doi.org/10.1093/treephys/25.7.903,,

Mature larvae overwintered before transforming to adults, which infested new hosts in early June. Scolytus piceae most commonly infested shaded out lower branches of mature live spruce. In sporadic wind-felled spruce, the beetle infested the terminal portion of branches throughout the crown, whereas another Scolytinae, Polygraphus rufipennis (Kirby), infested the thicker bark basal portion of the same branches. This niche separation resulted from difference in time of their dispersal flight and ability of S. piceae to colonize thin bark by engraving the underlying sapwood.

Predationi rates were determined for 759 nests placed in a systematic pattern within plots perpendicular to a forest-field ecotone created by commercial timber harvest in northern Idaho. One plot contained an abrupt edge and 1 contained a wide feathered edge of partial timber removal. Nests of 2 diameters (80 and 100 mm) were located on the ground and above ground in shrubs, and were placed in high- (20 nests/ha) and low-density (9 nests/ha) patterns. No difference was detected for predation rate with respect to nest location or size. Nests placed in a low-density pattern received higher percent predation than nests in a high-density pattern. The high-density plot had greater shrub cover, which may have restricted predator effectiveness. Predation rates were >4x higher in forest plots than field plots; these results may reflect relatively infrequent use of field subplots by avian predators requiring perch sites. Our data do not support the ecological trap hypothesis; we found no relationship between distance from edge and predation rate. However, our abrupt-edge subplots had higher predation than the feathered-edge subplots.

Egg galleries averaged 6.3 cm long and varied in orientation and shape; most were directed upward at an angle. Eggs were laid in a cluster (78 eggs average) along one side of the egg gallery. After eclosion, larvae fed side by side in a common brood chamber that often extended below ground level. Larvae had four instars. Mature larvae moved throughout frass in the brood chamber and pupated in separate cells. When transformed to adults, they tunneled actively throughout the brood chamber, enlarging it and scoring the sapvvood by their feeding. They emerged through ruptures in the weakened bark. Observations indicate that one generation per year occurs in nature, but broods that originate in late summer may possibly overwinter twice. Offspring of overwintered adults reached the adult stage in the laboratory (17-22°C) in as few as 46 d. Commensal and predacious organisms are listed.

uief_0224,Consumption of Sound and rotten coarse woody debri from a Northern Idaho Mixed Conifer Forest,"Hyde, Joshua C.",2010-10,Thesis,"Coarse woody debris in various states of decay is found in abundance in numerous forested ecosystems, serves a variety of ecosystem functions, and has the potential to affect air quality as it combusts. However, our understanding of the quantities of this debris consumed in forest fires is poor, especially when addressing debris in various states of decomposition; a condition which eventually affects all debris. In this study we examine the effect of decay on consumption and the wood properties of coarse woody debris using three numeric decay classification systems for logs between 7 and 23 cm in diameter and moisture contents between 6 and 13%. Results indicate that coarse woody debris in class four, the most advanced decay class, are likely to consume to a greater degree than logs in classes one through three. This supports the current convention of grouping all the classes into two broad categories, sound and rotten, in semi-empirical models such as Consume and the First Order Fire Effects Model. Intermediate classes showed high variation in consumption; this was in part due to surface properties which impact the decay classification and do not reflect the condition of the entire log. For this reason we suggest the use of physical properties to predict consumption of these fuels. In examining debris properties, wood density, lignin content, and volumetric heat content, were the most highly correlated with consumption. This study should be repeated in areas with different decomposition and combustion dynamics, such as that found in the southeastern United States.",UIEF; woody debris; forest litter; air quality; fire effects; decay classification; fire consumption; forest operations,East Hatter Creek,UIEF; East Hatter Creek,46.840526,-116.780027,,,,,,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,Unknown publisher,,record,https://www.frames.gov/documents/catalog/hyde_2010.pdf,,

However, there have been few studies that examine potential effects of biochar on insect communities. We examined the direct effects of one formulation of dry biochar on survival of four species of common forest insects: major adult workers of the thatch ants, Formica obscuripes Forel (Hymenoptera: Formicidae); adult bark beetles, Ips pini (Say) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) and adults of two bark beetle predators, Temnochila chlorodia (Mannerheim) (Coleoptera: Trogossitidae) and Enoclerus sphegeus (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Cleridae). There was a significant reduction in survival for three of the four species (F. obscuripes, I. pini and T. chlorodia) when exposed to dry biochar in confined arenas. The decreased survival only occurred when the insects had direct contact with the material. Further, while exposure to all particle sizes significantly decreased survival, the decreased survival was not different among the particle sizes tested (< 150 mm, > 1.0 mm, or a combination of particle sizes). The results demonstrate a potential for negative impacts on multiple insect species following exposure to dry biochar.

However, soil compaction occurring from mechanized harvesting operations often remains for many years and may contribute to a decline in long-term site productivity. A controlled experiment on a silt loam soil was conducted to determine (a) the effectiveness of logging slash to buffer compaction, (b) the influence of the number of machine passes, and (c) the contribution of soil moisture to changes in penetration resistance during a cut-to-length harvest in northern Idaho. Penetration resistance was measured at three soil depths (10, 20, and 30 cm) for three different moisture contents (low, medium, and high) and slash amounts (none, light, and heavy) after each of 12 machine passes (one pass each with a harvester and an empty forwarder, and 10 passes with a fully-loaded forwarder). At all three soil depths the main effect of moisture content and machine passes on penetration resistance was significant, but slash amounts alone did not significantly affect penetration resistance. After 12 passes, we measured the greatest penetration resistance in the medium soil moisture treatment at 5 to15 cm of soil depth. When evaluated at similar moisture contents after harvesting, the soil that was driest during machine traffic (low moisture treatment) had the lowest penetration resistance. Slash was important for protecting the soil against compaction in the medium and high soil moisture treatments. Penetration resistance did not significantly increase after the second pass of a fully-loaded forwarder (31,752 kg) at any moisture content or slash level. Managing felling operations to take advantage of dry soil conditions or using slash when soils are moist may help reduce ruts and avoid long-term compaction impacts on this soil type.",UIEF; soil compaction; penetration resistance; bulk density; slash; machine effects; harvesting operations; hazard reduction; mechanized harvesting; silt loam; slash buffer; soil moisture changes; forest operations,,UIEF,46.847222,-116.769444,,,,,Taylor and Francis,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,https://doi.org/10.1080/14942119.2006.10702532,,

Use of specially designed root boxes and a CO2 gas-flow compensating system designed around an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) allowed controlled delivery of CO2 to roots and simultaneous measurements of CO2 released by roots. Root respiration rate responded to each inlet [CO2], independent of whether the previous concentration had been higher or lower, within two to three hours (paired t test = 0.041, P= 0.622, and n= 13). Total and basal respiration rates decreased exponentially as soil [CO2] rose from 130 ppm, well below atmospheric [CO2], to 7015 ppm, a concentration not uncommon in field soils. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) showed that the effects of soil [CO2] on rates of total and basal root respiration were statistically significant. Root respiration rates decreased by 4 to 5 nmol CO2 g−1 dry weight of roots s−1 for every doubling of [CO2] according to the following equations: ln(R1) (nmol CO2 g−1 s−1) = 5.24–0.30*ln[CO2] with r= 0.78, P < 0.0001, and n= 70; and ln(Rb) (nmol CO2 g−1 s−1) = 6.29–0.52 * ln[CO2] with r= 0.82, P < 0.0001, and n= 35. The sensitivity of root respiration to [CO2] suggests that some previous laboratory measurements of root respiration at atmospheric [CO2], which is 3 to 10-fold lower than [CO2] in field soils, overestimated root respiration in the field.

To investigate variation in resistance to xylem cavitation among evergreen and deciduous coniferous trees from different environments, we analyzed conifers from upper and lower treeline. Species from lower treeline (Larix occidentalis and Pinus contorta) exhibited higher resistances to xylem cavitation compared to species from upper treeline (Larix lyallii and Pinus albicaulis). At lower treeline, the deciduous conifer Larix occidentalis was more resistant to xylem cavitation than the evergreen Pinus contorta. None of the four species experienced losses in stem hydraulic conductivity greater than 5% during the growing season. During the winter, lower treeline species experienced between 8 and 15% loss in xylem conductivity compared to greater than 30% for upper treeline species. At upper treeline, losses in stem hydraulic conductivity were correlated with freeze-thaw events, mid-winter warming periods and decreased stem water contents.

LiDAR remote sensing is a rapidly evolving technology for quantifying aboveground biomass and thereby carbon pools; however, little work has evaluated the efficacy of repeat LiDAR measures for spatially monitoring aboveground carbon pools through time. Our study objective was therefore to evaluate the use of discrete return airborne LiDAR for quantifying biomass change and carbon flux from repeat field and LiDAR surveys. We collected LiDAR data in 2003 and 2009 across ~ 20,000 ha of an actively managed, mixed conifer forest landscape in northern Idaho. The Random Forest machine learning algorithm was used to impute aboveground biomass pools of trees, saplings, shrubs, herbaceous plants, coarse and fine woody debris, litter, and duff using field-based forest inventory data and metrics derived from the LiDAR collections. Separate predictive tree aboveground biomass models were developed from the 2003 and 2009 field and LiDAR data, and biomass change was estimated at the plot, pixel, and landscape levels by subtracting 2003 predictions from 2009 predictions. Traditional stand exam data were used to independently validate 2003 and 2009 tree aboveground biomass predictions and tree aboveground biomass change estimates at the stand level. Over this 6-year period, we found a mean increase in tree aboveground biomass due to forest growth across the non-harvested portions of 4.1 Mg/ha/yr. We found that 26.3% of the landscape had been harvested during this time period which outweighed growth at the landscape level, resulting in a net tree aboveground biomass change of − 5.7 Mg/ha/yr, and − 2.3 Mg/ha/yr in total aboveground carbon, summed across all the aboveground biomass pools. Change in aboveground biomass was related to forest successional status; younger stands gained two- to three-fold less biomass than did more mature stands. This result suggests that even the most mature forest stands are valuable carbon sinks, and implies that forest management decisions that include longer harvest rotation cycles are likely to favor higher levels of aboveground carbon storage in this system. A 30-fold difference in LiDAR sampling density between the 2003 and 2009 collections did not affect plot-scale biomass estimation. These results suggest that repeat LiDAR surveys are useful for accurately quantifying high resolution, spatially explicit biomass and carbon dynamics in conifer forests.",UIEF; aboveground biomass; forest growth; landscape-level carbon flux; biomass change; forest carbon monitoring; LiDAR; forest policy; atmospheric carbon dioxide; forest carbon pools; remote sensing; woody debris; forest ecology,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,Science Direct,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,Access issues,,record,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2012.02.023,,

The success of these analyses relies on accurate measurement of physiological processes. Respiration in the woody tissue of forest trees can consume up to 33% of annual net daytime carbon assimilation (Ryan et al., 1994). Woody-tissue respiration can be measured in situ using removable cuvettes (Ryan, 1990; Sprugel, 1990; Sprugel and Benecke, 1991). However, questions regarding the use of such cuvettes have arisen. For example, it is important that the amount 108of woody-tissue contributing to a measurement is correctly determined, especially when one considers that stand level estimates of woody-tissue respiration are often based on measurements made over just a few square decimeters. The difficulty arises from the gasket material used to seal the cuvettes to tissue sections. Is the respiring tissue volume: (a) the portion between the interior edges of the gaskets, or (b) the portion between the gasket midpoints? The latter volume may exceed the former by more than 15%.",UIEF; physiology; Douglas-fir; pseudotsuga menziesii; respiration; woody tissues; silviculture,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,Taylor and Francis,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,Access issues,,record,https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781003210641-14/co2-diffusion-douglas-fir-bark-implications-measuring-woody-tissue-respiration-removable-cuvettes-lucas-cernusak-nate-mcdowell-john-marshall,,

The hypothesis was that standard soil survey procedures would provide edaphic data that could predict site index in the absence of site trees. Soil profile descriptions and physical analyses were obtained on 133 plots, along with several physiographic site descriptors. Chemical analyses were performed on soil samples from a third of these plots, and moisture availability was determined on 60% of the plots. Site index was based on felled-tree stem analyses. Elevation was the strongest predictor, accounting for a third of the variation in site index. The addition of habitat type information resulted in a significant improvement (as did longitude and precipitation), but still left over half the variation unexplained. After examining numerous soil properties the standard error could only be reduced 0.3 m, a disappointing result in light of the considerable time and expense necessary for soil sampling. The causes of these low soil–site correlations could not be conclusively determined, but the most likely explanations are (i) that the number of important site factor interactions occurring in this large and complex study area far exceeded the sample size, and (ii) failure to measure the true causes of site productivity.",UIEF; soil-site study; Douglas-fir; pseudotsuga menziesii; soil survey; site index; soil profile; habitat type; soil health; forest health; forest ecology,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,Canadian Journal of Forest Research,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,Access issues,,record,https://doi.org/10.1139/x90-092,,
uief_0241,Storage and Transpiration have Negligible Effects on δ13C of Stem CO2 Efflux in Large Conifer Trees,"Ubierna, Nerea; Kumar, Arjun S.; Cernusak, Lucas A.; Pangle, Robert E.; Gag, Peter J.; Marshall, John D.",2009-12,Research Article,"Stem respiration rates are often quantified by measuring the CO2 efflux from stems into chambers. It has been suggested that these measurements underestimate respiration because some of the respired CO2 can be either retained or transported upwards in the transpiration stream. If the stem CO2 efflux does not represent all respired CO2, then the interpretation of its isotopic signal may be compromised as well. The C-isotope composition of the respired CO2 and the measured efflux could differ due to (i) the release of CO2 produced elsewhere into the stem and transported upwards in xylem water (soil CO2 or root respired CO2); (ii) the retention or release of CO2 storage pools within the tree stem and (iii) the removal of CO2 by the transpiration stream. We investigated the effects of these processes in large conifer trees using two manipulative experiments: a labelling experiment and a crown removal experiment. The labelling experiment used an extreme enrichment of dissolved CO2 in soil water to assess the C uptake by the roots. In this experiment, we found no contamination of the stem CO2 pool despite clear evidence that the water itself had been taken up. The crown removal experiment tested for vertical CO2 flux in xylem water by eliminating transpiration. Here, we found no change in the δ13C of stem CO2 efflux (δEA; P > 0.05). We concluded that for these large conifers, sap-flow influenced neither δ13C of stem efflux nor that of the stem CO2 pool. By parameterizing Henry’s Law for conditions inside the stem, we estimated the transport flux to represent 1–3% of the stem CO2 efflux to the atmosphere. Finally, assuming a 2‰ difference between δ13C of root and stem respiration, we estimated that potential contamination of δEA by root respired CO2 would be < 0.1‰. Thus, neither the release of soil or root CO2, nor storage in the stem, nor vertical transport of CO2 in the xylem sap had any detectable influence on δ13C of the CO2 measured in stem efflux.",UIEF; stem respiration; conifer forests; carbon dioxide efflux; C-isotope composition; carbon pool; soil carbon; forest biology,Big Meadow Creek,UIEF; Big Meadow Creek,46.799488,-116.812869,,,,,Tree Physiology,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,https://doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpp089,,
uief_0242,Supercritical Methanol Treatment of Wood for Chemical Production,"Soria, Juan Andres",2005-12,Dissertation,"Ponderosa pine wood was solubilized in a single step process using supercritical methanol (SCM). The solubilization of wood was optimized using a response surface method with a central composite design, using as independent variables biomass quantity, the methanol volume fraction (VF) and temperature. The optimal conditions resulting in 98% solubilization were temperature of 500 °C , VF of 0.47. Statistical analysis also shows that temperature, the VF and their interactions had statistical significance in liquefying wood. Based on the optimization study, five treatment regimes were developed to summarize all experimental conditions studied, based on variables temperature (T) and VF, as follows: T235/VF0.46, T235/VF0.59, T367/VF0.52, T500/VF0.46 and T500/VF0.59. Within these ranges, the near optimal conditions were found at T500/VF0.46 with a SCM density of 0.325 g cm'1. After treatment, the reactor mixture was fractionated into solids, methanol solubles and gases. The solid fraction was analyzed by Pyrolysis GCMS and FTIR spectroscopy showing the presence of mainly polysaccharides and a minor amount of lignin. The volatile components of the methanol soluble fraction were analyzed by GCMS showing the presence of extractives, monomeric lignin structures and carbohydrate dehydration and thermal breakdown products. The water soluble non-volatile components in the methanol soluble fraction were analyzed by HPLC and showed presence of disaccharides, monosaccharides, methylglycosides and 1,6 anhydro monosaccharides. The organic soluble non-volatile components were analyzed by GPC which showed the presence of mainly monomeric, oligomeric and polymeric lignin fragments, indicating the validity of the supercritical methanol treatment in breaking down the natural wood polymer matrix into its building block components. Gas analysis showed CO2 as the main component, indicating the thermal degradation of wood. For the optimal SCM wood depolymerization conditions it was found that extractives are readily removed, with lignin polymers undergoing cleavage of the (3-ether bonds and going into solution. As the lignin solubilizes, exposed wood polysaccharides become exposed and can depolymerize and be solubilized in methanol. The process described in this dissertation can be used to identify several species of interest to drive future endeavors in bio-refinery applications, and for finding potential substitutes for chemical commodities currently generated by petroleum resources.",UIEF; supercritical methanol; SCM; ponderosa pine; woody tissues; wood solubilization; forest products,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations Publishing,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,https://www.proquest.com/docview/305013491?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true,,

Trees, outplanted as one-year-old seedlings from a container nursery, were in their 32nd growing season on the site. We found that the trees had deployed more roots, in terms of length and volume, in the downslope and windward quadrants than in their upslope and leeward quadrants, likely a response to mechanical forces toward improving stability. Moreover, we observed the development of three types of root cages (tight, enlarged, and diffused) that likely reflect micro-site characteristics. As the cage type transitioned from tight to enlarged to diffused we measured a decrease in the overall volume of the roots associated with the cage and the taproot becoming a more prominent contributor to the overall volume of the cage. Finally, we noted the development of specialty roots, namely those with I-beam and T-beam shapes in cross section, in the downslope quadrant; these types of roots are known to better counteract compression mechanical forces. These observations improve our understanding of root plasticity and tree rooting response to environmental stimuli, which is becoming an increasingly critical topic as changes in climate increase the frequency and intensity of storms.",UIEF; silviculture; root systems; pinus ponderosa; ponderosa pine; slope; root system architecture; growing season; silviculture,,UIEF,46.84224,-116.871035,,,,,Frontiers in Plant Science,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2019.00947,,

We examined the effects of early-summer versus late-summer sheep grazing on autumn and winter browse quality in northern Idaho. Nutritive quality of 6 shrub species collected in September (autumn) and November (winter) was measured following early-summer (May-June) sheep grazing, late-summer (August) sheep grazing, and no grazing in 1993 and 1994. Shrub samples were analyzed for crude protein (CP), available protein, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and acid detergent lignin. Relative to the ungrazed control, early-summer sheep grazing improved both autumn and winter brose quality in redstem ceanothus (Ceanothus sanguineus), ninebark (Phsyocarpus malvaceus), rose (Rosa spp.), and snowberry (Symphoricarpus spp.). Early-summer sheep grazing improved brose quality of thimbleberry (Rubus parciflorus) in autumn but had no effect on its nutritive quality in winter. In contrast, late-summer sheep grazing reduced both autumn and winter brose quality in redstem ceanothus and inebark. Late-summer grazing reduced sutumn browse quality in snowberry and rose but improved browse quality of rose in winter. Scouler willow (Salix sciouleriana) was not readily selected by sheep in either grazing season, whicch explains why the nutritive quality of Scouler willow in autumn and winter was unaffected by the grazing treatments. For most browse species, fiber content in autumn and winter was higher in 1993 than 1994, due to weather conditions. We conclude that prescribed sheep grazing can either improve or reduce autumn and winter browse nutritive quality for wild ungulates, depending on weather conditions and the intensity of sheep browsing. For transitory ranges of the Inland Northwest, we suggest browse quality will likely improve in moderate sheep grazing (40-55% relative utilization) in summer ceases by mid-to late June. Autumn and winter browse quality should be largely unaffected if moderate sheep grazing in summer ceases by mid-August. Browse quality in autumn will probably be lowered if sheep grazing occurs in late August, but moderate sheep grazing in late August will have relatively minor effects on browse quality in winter.",wildlife,Flat Creek,UIEF; Flat Creek,46.851013,-116.724478,,,,,Journal of Wildlife Management,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,Access issues,,record,https://doi.org/10.2307/3802518,,

However, the strength of this relationship has been neither tested nor adequately demonstrated with field measurements. We measured surface fuel loads and cover fractions of white ash and four other surface materials (green vegetation, brown non-photosynthetic vegetation, black char and mineral soil) immediately before and after eight prescribed fires in four disparate fuelbed types: boreal forest floor, mixed conifer woody slash, mixed conifer understorey and longleaf pine understorey. We hypothesised that increased white ash cover should correlate significantly to surface fuel consumption. To test this hypothesis, we correlated field measures of surface fuel consumption with field measures of surface cover change. Across all four fuelbed types, we found increased white ash cover to be the only measure of surface cover change that correlated significantly to surface fuel consumption, supporting our hypothesis. We conclude that white ash load calculated from immediate post-fire measurements of white ash cover, depth and density may provide an even more accurate proxy for surface fuel consumption, and furthermore a more physically based indicator of fire severity that could be incorporated into rapid response, retrospective wildfire assessments.",UIEF; white ash; surface fuels; forest fuels; fuel load; ash cover; surface fuel consumption; wildland fire; land use; land cover change; black char; fire effects; fire severity; fuelbed; prescribed fire; fire,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,International Journal of Wildland Fire,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,Access issues,,record,https://doi.org/10.1071/WF12150,,

And yet, this is not folklore from our wild west past, but a real issue of our time that has not been addressed. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics demonstrates that logging has the highest occupational fatality rate1 and one of the highest rates of days away from work.2 In 2019 Oregon State had seven logging fatalities.3 The impact of these fatalities on rural communities is profound. A 2019 survey of 500 loggers in the Northwest found that 93% had experienced the loss of someone they knew from a logging incident. Forestry contractors are often small employers or independent contractors who may be operating with limited financial resources. In the last two decades, more timberland is being managed as investment trusts. Meanwhile, those working in the logging industry struggle to maintain their workforce that heavily relies on immigrant labor.5,6 This fissured organizational system complicates addressing worker safety needs and may inadvertently exacerbate hazardous conditions. Enumeration of the forestry workforce is challenging due to the high number of independent contractors and farm foresters, undocumented immigrant workers, and crossover with other occupations. Occupational health and forest management professionals need to be prepared to address an upswing in forest products and land management. These trends are driven by the threat of wildfire and expanded demand for US timber. In the past, public health organizations and the forestry industry have fallen short in addressing the safety of this workforce, but there are new efforts underway. New investments in U.S. forestry safety have been made in recent years, including increased funding priorities and research grants by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).

Climate change mitigation by bioenergy use is investigated in this dissertation using three studies that explore woody bioenergy crops. First, hybrid poplar bioenergy plantations and adjacent agricultural crops at three northwestern locations were monitored for soil greenhouse gases (GHGs). Converting agricultural land to bioenergy crops did not adversely affect soil GHG fluxes. Second, this dissertation investigated the utilization of the bioenergy co-product, biochar. Biochar is a soil amendment that can be used to potentially mitigate climate change by affecting GHG emissions or carbon (C) sequestration. Biochar amendment was applied at three rates (0, 2.5, and 25 Mg ha-1) to the soil surface of five northwestern conifer forests one to five years prior  to measuring soil GHG fluxes, C content, microbial community, and tree diameter growth. Biochar amendments increased C content at the highest application rate and did not affect soil GHGs, microbial communities, or tree diameter growth. Finally, tree seedlings for forest regeneration were grown with biochar amended to peat-based growing media to reduce peat and fertilizer needs in an operational forest nursery. Biochar amendment decreased seedling growth, most likely due to increased pH, but biochar amended seedlings had increased cold hardiness and greater root growth potential (for a given seedling size). Biochar amendment did not reduce fertilizer needs to grow an equivalent-sized seedling.

Fine-scale fire behaviour during prescribed fires has been identified as a strong predictor of post-fire tree recovery and growth, but most studies report these metrics averaged over the entire fire. Previous research has found inconsistent effects of low-intensity fire on mature Pinus ponderosa growth. In this study, fire behaviour was quantified at the tree scale and compared with post-fire radial growth and axial resin duct defences. Results show a clear dose–response relationship between peak fire radiative power per unit area (W m–2) and post-fire Pinus ponderosa radial growth. Unlike in previous laboratory research on seedlings, there was no dose–response relationship observed between fire radiative energy per unit area (J m–2) and post-fire mature tree growth in the surviving trees. These results may suggest that post-fire impacts on growth of surviving seedlings and mature trees require other modes of heat transfer to impact plant canopies. This study demonstrates that increased resin duct defence is induced regardless of fire intensity, which may decrease Pinus ponderosa vulnerability to secondary mortality agents.",UIEF; fire behavior; ecophysiology; radial growth; fuels; radiative flux; fire,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,International Journal of Wildland Fire,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,Access issues,,record,https://doi.org/10.1071/WF16139,,

Many land use change models use remotely-sensed images to make predictions based on historical trends. One alternative is a survey-based approach in which landowners’ stated intentions are modeled. The objectives of our research were to: (1) develop a survey-based landowner decision model (SBM) to simulate future land use changes, (2) compare projections from the SBM with those from a trend-based model (TBM), and (3) demonstrate how two alternative policy scenarios can be incorporated into the SBM and compared. We modeled relationships between land management decisions, collected from a mail survey of private landowners, and the landscape, using remotely-sensed imagery and ownership parcel data. We found that SBM projections were within the range of TBM projections and that the SBM was less affected by errors in image classification. Our analysis of alternative policies demonstrates the importance of understanding potential effects of targeted land use policies. While policies oriented toward increasing enrollment in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) resulted in a large (11–13%) increase in CRP lands, policies targeting increased forest thinning on private non-industrial lands increased low-density forest projections by only 1%. The SBM approach is particularly appropriate for landscapes including many landowners, because it reflects the decision-making of the landowners whose individual actions will result in collective landscape change.",UIEF; land cover change; land use; landowner decision model; land change predictions; landscape projections; remote sensing; forest ecology,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,Springer Link,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,Access issues,,record,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-007-9159-6,,

Light detection and ranging (lidar) is useful for acquiring fine-resolution, three-dimensional data on vegetation structure across broad areas. We evaluated Brown Creeper occupancy of forested landscapes by using lidar-derived canopy metrics in two coniferous forests in Idaho. Density of the upper canopy was the most important variable for predicting Brown Creeper occupancy, although mean height and height variability were also included in the top models. The upper canopy was twice as dense and the mean height was almost 50% higher at occupied than at unoccupied sites. Previous studies have found indicators of canopy density to be important factors for Brown Creeper habitat; however, this represents the first time that lidar data have been used to examine this relationship empirically through the mapping of the upper canopy density that cannot be continuously quantified by field-based methods or passive remote sensing. Our model's performance was classified as “good” by multiple criteria. We were able to map probabilities of Brown Creeper occupancy in ∼50 000 ha of forest, probabilities that can be used at the local, forest-stand, and landscape scales, and illustrate the potential utility of lidar-derived data for studies of avian distributions in forested landscapes.",UIEF; brown creeper; land change; habitat; forest ecology; forest health; indicator species; old-growth; LiDAR; canopy density; wildlife,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,The Cooper Ornithological Society,Fish and Wildlife Sciences,,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,https://doi.org/10.1525/cond.2013.110082,,

Twenty-five of 46 northern pocket gophers were fitted in the field with one of three models of radio-collars (AVM, NWRC, and Holohil), nine received Wildlife Materials abdominal implant transmitters (surgery conducted off-site), and 12 without transmitters served as controls. Study animals were relocated every second to fourth day until the end of the study. Individuals not retrieved by the end of the study were captured with live traps or kill traps. Recovery of marked animals (82.6%) and transmitters (82.4%) was high. Radio-collar shedding (35.3%) was a common phenomenon, but all implants remained intact. Transmitter malfunctions were infrequent. Physical side effects of the collars were uncommon (8.8%). No adverse effects of the implants were evident. Negative behavioral effects of transmitters included reduced spatial use and extreme length of claws on the front feet. No significant differences (P = 0.23) in body mass between the control and radio-marked northern pocket gophers were noted at the end of the study. Effective life of transmitters varied significantly (P = 0.01), with the Holohil collars having the greatest longevity (mean = 87.6, S. E. = 11.72 days). Though no single transmitter emerged as a superior choice for extended field studies, the Holohil model performed the best.

In a pilot study of three western conifers, we identified xerotolerant endophytic fungi dominant in the roots. We hypothesized that xerotolerant fungi dominate the root endophyte communities of woody plants in summer across the arid intermountain PNW without regard to host. We isolated fungi in summer from fine lateral roots of ten gymnosperm species and nine angiosperm species, spanning both ecto- and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses, using both a xerophile-selective medium with a water potential at − 20 MPa and a non-selective medium with adequate water availability. Penicillium and Phialocephala together constituted 69% (4742–6872) of all culturable isolates across all host species in fine lateral roots of woody plants across the region, regardless of mycorrhizal strategy or whether the hosts were gymnosperm or angiosperm. In paired t-tests, Penicillium spp. exhibited greater xerotolerance (53% of all isolates on glycerol-amended PDA belonged to Penicillium, but only 16% of PDA isolates did (P < 0.0001)) across all plants sampled. Phialocephala exhibited the opposite pattern: 21% and 42% of all isolates on glycerol-amended and standard PDA, respectively, with a significant difference among paired samples across plant species (P < 0.0001). Whereas 95.5% of representative isolates of sampled regional phylotypes of Penicillium were xerotolerant, only 22.2% of Phialocephala were. Xerotolerance was much more common in roots than in foliage: 54.2% of all root isolates were xerotolerant versus only 10.2% of needle isolates (P < 0.0001) in Pseudotsuga menziesii.

The year of 2015, which had the most extreme drought for the area on record, offered a potential analogue of future conditions. During this period, we measured the daily courses of water potential and gas exchange as well as the hydraulic conductivity and vulnerability to embolism of six dominant native conifer species, Abies grandis, Larix occidentalis, Pinus ponderosa, Pinus monticola, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Thuja occidentalis, to determine their responses to 5 months of record-low precipitation. The deep ash-capped soils of the region allowed gas exchange to continue without significant evidence of water stress for almost 2 months after the last rainfall event. Midday water potentials never fell below −2.2 MPa in the evergreen species and −2.7 MPa in the one deciduous species. Branch xylem was resistant to embolism, with P50 values ranging from −3.3 to −7.0 MPa. Root xylem, however, was more vulnerable, with P50 values from −1.3 to −4.6 MPa. With predawn water potentials as low as −1.3 MPa, the two Pinus species likely experienced declines in root hydraulic conductivity. Stomatal conductance of all six species was significantly responsive to vapour pressure only in the dry months (August–October), with no response evident in the wet months (June–July). While there were similarities among species, they exhibited a continuum of isohydry and safety margins. Despite the severity of this drought, all species were able to continue photosynthesis until mid-October, likely due to the mediating effects of the meter-deep, ash-capped silty-loam soils with large water storage capacity. Areas with these soil types, which are characteristic of much of the northwestern USA, could serve as refugia under drier and warmer future conditions.",UIEF; drought years; climate predictions; seasonal drought; embolism; water potential; gas exchange; isohydry; silviculture,,UIEF,46.833333,-116.716667,,,,,Oxford Academic,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,https://doi.org/10.1093/aobpla/plz056,,

We predicted avian species richness in two mixed conifer forests, Moscow Mountain and Slate Creek, containing different management contexts and located in north-central Idaho. We utilized general linear models and an AIC model selection approach to examine the relative importance of a wide range of remotely-sensed ecological variables, including LiDAR-derived metrics of vertical and horizontal structural heterogeneities of both vegetation and terrain, and Landsat-derived vegetation reflectance indices. We also examined the relative importance of these remotely sensed variables in predicting nesting guild distributions of ground/understory nesters, mid-upper canopy nesters, and cavity nesters. All top models were statistically significant, with adjusted R2s ranging from 0.05 to 0.42. Regardless of study area, the density of the understory was positively associated with total species richness and the ground/understory nesting guild. However, the relative importance of ecological predictors generally differed between the study areas and among the nesting guilds. For example, for mid-upper canopy nester richness, the best predictors at Moscow Mountain included height variability and canopy density whereas at Slate Creek they included slope, elevation, patch diversity and height variability. Topographic variables were not found to influence species richness at Moscow Mountain but were strong predictors of avian species richness at the higher elevation Slate Creek, where species richness decreased with increasing slope and elevation. A variance in responses between focal areas suggests that we expand such studies to determine the relative importance of different factors in determining species richness.

However, other microbes within the foliar microbiome may increase or decrease disease severity as either pathogen enablers or antagonists. The frequency and extent of such disease modification in nature are largely unknown, but modification is likely to occur at high frequency in the native range of a pathogen. In this study, we provided an opportunity for six fungi to modify the severity of Dothistroma needle blight in Pinus ponderosa within part of the native range of the disease near Priest River, Idaho, USA. Five fungi were common members of the P. ponderosa microbiome in the region, and one was isolated from co-occurring Pseudotsuga menziesii. Inoculum of each of the six was applied to an average of 187 newly emerging needles in the candles (new shoots) of each of ten, seven-year-old trees; control candles were treated with sterile distilled water. Disease severity per needle (i.e., lesion length/total needle length) was determined one year later following natural infection and development of Dothistroma needle blight in a total of 13,085 needles. Five of the six fungi significantly modified disease severity; the overall model (“inoculant”, “tree”, and “inoculant x tree” as predictors) explained 53% of the variation in disease severity. Penicillium goetzii was the sole antagonist and reduced disease severity by nearly 7% compared to control needles. Four of the fungi (Sydowia polyspora, Bionectria ochroleuca, Penicillium raistrickii, and a culturable species of Elytroderma) acted as pathogen enablers, increasing disease severity 4.7%, 4.2%, 3.6%, and 2.5%, respectively. Our results show that microbial modification of expression of Dothistroma needle blight in nature may be common within the native range of the pathogen. However, with more thorough sampling of the P. ponderosa microbiome, the extent of modification may go beyond the modest effects reported here for just a few members of the microbiome of the host and its forest community.",UIEF; foliar disease; needle blight; fungi; forest relationships; forest ecology; pathogens; host trees; disease severity; asymptomatic needles; forest pathology,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,Science Direct,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2014.11.010,,

I performed a series of field experiments in which I investigated the transmission dynamics of the nuclear poly— hedrosis virus (NPV) of Douglas—fir tussock moth, Orgyia pseudotsugata (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae), in northern Idaho, USA. In these experiments, I reared healthy and infected healthy larvae that became infected as a measure of transmission. I explored the influences of density, stage structure, and spatial structure on transmission by manipulating the density and stage distribution of healthy and infected hosts, and the spatial distribution of infected hosts. The experiments indicate that transmission is strongly affected by the densities of both healthy and infected hosts, but the effect depends on the instar of each. Late instars are both more infectious and more likely to become infected than are early instars, so that the NPV is more likely to spread in populations of late—instar tussock moth larvae. I also found that transmission is affected by the spatial distribution of infected hosts, and this effect also depends on the instar of healthy hosts. That is, transmission to healthy early instars decreases with increasing patchiness of infected hosts, but transmission to healthy late instars is essentially unaffected by patchiness. I discuss how these results can be in— terpreted in terms of behavioral differences among instars, and relate the results to the mathematical theory of disease and the use of viruses in biological pest control.",UIEF; pest control; population dynamics; insect viruses; nuclear polyhedrosis virus; tussock moth; forest entomology,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,Ecological Society of America,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,Access issues,,record,https://doi.org/10.2307/2937196,,

Visibility is the property that relates 3D habitat structure to accessibility of visual information. Despite the importance of visibility in animal ecology, this property remains largely unstudied. Our objective was to assess how habitat structure from diverse environments and animal position within that structure can influence visibility. We gathered terrestrial lidar data (1 cm at 10 m) in four ecosystems (forest, shrub-steppe, prairie, and desert) to characterize viewsheds (i.e., estimates of visibility based on spatially explicit sightlines) from multiple vantage points. Both ecosystem-specific structure and animal position influenced potential viewsheds. Generally, as height of the vantage point above the ground increased, viewshed extent also increased, but the relationships were not linear. In low-structure ecosystems (prairie, shrub-steppe, and desert), variability in viewsheds decreased as vantage points increased to heights above the vegetation canopy. In the forest, however, variation in viewsheds was highest at intermediate heights, and markedly lower at the lowest and highest vantage points.

Our goals were to increase our understanding of the evolution of volatile pheromones within the Cerambycidae, their role in reproductive isolation and to identify pheromones for use in the development of lures for monitoring cerambycids. Over 3 yr, we tested 12 compounds known to be cerambycid pheromones as possible attractants at sites across Idaho. This study focused on species within the cerambycine genus Phymatodes (Tribe: Callidiini). We also collected and analyzed headspace volatiles of captured Phymatodes dimidiatus (Kirby). Our results demonstrate that (R)-2-methylbutan-1-ol is a male-produced volatile pheromone for P. dimidiatus. These results are consistent with prior research suggesting that (R)-2-methylbutan-1-ol and (R)-3-hydroxyhexan-2-one, individually or in a blend of both compounds, commonly serve as pheromones for Phymatodes spp. We captured Phymatodes starting in mid-May, continuing through mid-August. Our data indicate that flight periods of Phymatodes spp. in Idaho overlap. These species may be utilizing various mechanisms to ensure reproductive isolation, such as the production of different volatile pheromones, minor components, and/or proportions of components, utilizing different host species and/or host volatiles, differing daily activity periods, and/or occupying different heights in the tree canopy. Our results contribute to the basic understanding of the chemical and behavioral ecology of the Cerambycidae and can be applied to the development of pheromone lures for monitoring of economically important or endangered species.",UIEF; entomology; pheromones; pheromone parsimony; volatile pheromones; Cerambycidae; chemical ecology; forest entomology,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,Oxford Academic,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,https://doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvaa092,,

Bark photosynthesis reduces losses of respired CO2 from the underlying stem. As a consequence, the isotopic composition of source CO2 and the CO2 concentration around the chloroplasts are quite different from those of photosynthesizing leaves. We found three lines of evidence that bark photosynthesis discriminates against 13C. First, in bark of Populus tremuloides, the δ13C of CO2 efflux increased from –24.2‰ in darkness to –15.8‰ in the light. In Pinus monticola, the δ13C of CO2 efflux increased from –27.7‰ in darkness to –10.2‰ in the light. Observed increases in δ13C were generally in good agreement with predictions from the theoretical model. Second, we found that δ13C of dark-respired CO2 decreased following 2–3 h of illumination (P<0.01 for Populus tremuloides, P<0.001 for Pinus monticola). These decreases suggest that refixed photosynthate rapidly mixes into the respiratory substrate pool. Third, a field experiment demonstrated that bark photosynthesis influenced whole-tissue δ13C. Long-term light exclusion caused a localized increase in the δ13C of whole bark and current-year wood in branches of P. monticola (P<0.001 and P<0.0001, respectively). Thus bark photosynthesis was shown to discriminate against 13C and create a pool of photosynthate isotopically lighter than the dark respiratory pool in all three experiments. Failure to account for discrimination during bark photosynthesis could interfere with interpretation of the δ13C in woody tissues or in woody-tissue respiration.",UIEF; carbon; photosynthesis; tree bark; carbon isotope; respiration; respiratory substrate pool; carbon pool; woody tissues; forest ecology,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,Springer Link,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,Access issues,,record,https://doi.org/10.1007/s004420100629,,

Don) is an economically, ecologically and culturally important tree species in the Pacific Northwest. Recent observations (both through aerial surveys and on the ground) have found declining (crown thinning, branch die-off) and mortality western redcedars across its range. Despite this, a meta-synthesis of the relevant literature found that its response to prolonged drought remains understudied. I developed ecological niche models using observed western redcedar dieback points from 2017-2019 United States Forest Service Aerial Detection Surveys, which found that dieback occurred in the hotter extents of its range where dryness increased relative to the 30-year normal, suggesting that drought may be the primary agent of dieback. I subsequently developed a field study to examine the relationship between topography and water stress, and morphological and physiological plasticity of leaf traits at different microsites. Lower topographic positions, in this case a ravine bottom, were found to be less vulnerable to historic drought than higher topographic positions, regardless of canopy position. Trees immediately adjacent to a clear cut subjected to open canopy positions had leaf traits associated with higher water use efficiency relative to trees within the same the stand subjected to closed canopy positions. This suggests that western redcedar may have to ability to acclimate to increased levels of water stress in a period of less than a decade.",UIEF; thuja plicata; drought; forest products; tree mortality; dieback; ecological niche models; topography; water stress; silviculture,Flat Creek,UIEF; Flat Creek,46.841,-116.776,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations Publishing,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2708740210?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true,,

Kasten",2019-12,Research Article,"Our knowledge of the root system architecture of trees is still incomplete, especially concerning how biomass partitioning is regulated to achieve an optimal, but often unequal, distribution of resources. In addition, our comprehension of root system architecture development as a result of the adaptation process is limited because most studies lack a temporal approach. To add to our understanding, we excavated 32-year-old Pinus ponderosa trees from a steep, forested site in northern Idaho USA. The root systems were discretized by a low magnetic field digitizer and along with AMAPmod software we examined their root traits (i.e. order category, topology, growth direction length, and volume) in four quadrants: downslope, upslope, windward, and leeward. On one tree, we analyzed tree rings to compare the ages of lateral roots relative to their parental root, and to assess the occurrence of compression wood. We found that, from their onset, first-order lateral roots have similar patterns of ring eccentricity suggesting an innate ability to respond to different mechanical forces; more root system was allocated downslope and to the windward quadrant. In addition, we noted that shallow roots, which all presented compression wood, appear to be the most important component of anchorage. Finally, we observed that lateral roots can change growth direction in response to mechanical forces, as well as produce new lateral roots at any development stage and wherever along their axis. These findings suggest that trees adjust their root spatial deployment in response to environmental conditions, these roots form compression wood to dissipate mechanical forces, and new lateral roots can arise anywhere and at any time on the existing system in apparent response to mechanical forces.",UIEF; ponderosa pine; root system architecture; tree anchorage; mechanical forces; lateral root emission; compression wood; annual tree ring; silviculture,,UIEF,46.84224,-116.871035,,,,,Science Direct,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dendro.2019.125650,,

The standard infrastructure design approach relies on local precipitation-based intensity-duration-frequency (PREC-IDF) curves that do not account for snow process and assume stationary climate, leading to high failure risk and increased maintenance costs. This paper reviews the recently developed next-generation IDF (NG-IDF) curves that explicitly account for the mechanisms of extreme water available for runoff including rainfall, snowmelt, and rain-on-snow under nonstationary climate. The NG-IDF curve is an enhancement to the PREC-IDF curve and provides a consistent design approach across rain- to snow-dominated regions, which can benefit engineers and planners responsible for designing climate-resilient facilities, federal emergency agencies responsible for the flood insurance program, and local jurisdictions responsible for developing design manuals and approving subsequent infrastructure designs. Further, we discuss the recent advances in climate and hydrologic science communities that have not been translated into actional information in the engineering community. To bridge the gap, we advocate that building climate-resilient infrastructure goes beyond the traditional local design scale where engineers rely on recipe-based methods only; the future hydrologic design is a multi-scale problem and requires closer collaboration between climate scientists, hydrologists, and civil engineers.",UIEF; return intervals; flood timing; watershed; flood infrastructure; precipitation; watershed management,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,Frontiers in Water,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,https://doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2020.545051,,

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing is a promising technology for achieving accurate estimates of aboveground biomass and thereby carbon pools; however, not much is known about the accuracy of estimating biomass change and carbon flux from repeat LiDAR acquisitions containing different data sampling characteristics. In this study, discrete return airborne LiDAR data was collected in 2003 and 2009 across ~20,000 hectares (ha) of an actively managed, mixed conifer forest landscape in northern Idaho, USA. Forest inventory plots, established via a random stratified sampling design, were established and sampled in 2003 and 2009. The Random Forest machine learning algorithm was used to establish statistical relationships between inventory data and forest structural metrics derived from the LiDAR acquisitions. Aboveground biomass maps were created for the study area based on statistical relationships developed at the plot level. Over this 6-year period, we found that the mean increase in biomass due to forest growth across the non-harvested portions of the study area was 4.8 metric ton/hectare (Mg/ha). In these non-harvested areas, we found a significant difference in biomass increase among forest successional stages, with a higher biomass increase in mature and old forest compared to stand initiation and young forest. Approximately 20% of the landscape had been disturbed by harvest activities during the six-year time period, representing a biomass loss of >70 Mg/ha in these areas. During the study period, these harvest activities outweighed growth at the landscape scale, resulting in an overall loss in aboveground carbon at this site. The 30-fold increase in sampling density between the 2003 and 2009 did not affect the biomass estimates. Overall, LiDAR data coupled with field reference data offer a powerful method for calculating pools and changes in aboveground carbon in forested systems. The results of our study suggest that multitemporal LiDAR-based approaches are likely to be useful for high quality estimates of aboveground carbon change in conifer forest systems.",UIEF; policy; carbon pool; carbon flux; forest carbon; atmospheric carbon dioxide; GEG; biomass; woody tissues; LiDAR; forest ecology,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,US Department of Energy,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,Access issues,,record,https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usdoepub/355/,,

The pattern and intensity of these forces were modelled along the root segment from the branching point to the cage edge. Data of root cage volume in the upper 30 cm of soil showed a higher value in the downslope and windward quadrant while, at a deeper soil depth (>30 cm), we found higher values in both upslope and leeward quadrants. The analysis of radius length and the cross-sectional area of the shallow lateral roots revealed the presence of a considerable degree of eccentricity of the annual rings at the branching point and at the cage edge. This eccentricity is due to the formation of compression wood, and the eccentricity changes from the top portion at the branching point to the bottom portion at the cage edge, which we hypothesize may be a response to the variation in mechanical forces occurring in the various zones of the cage.

For instance, devices equipped with global navigation satellite system and radio frequency transmission (GNSS-RF) enable real-time data collection and sharing of positional data in remote, off-the-grid environments where cellular and internet availability are otherwise inaccessible. In this study, consumer-grade GNSS-RF data were evaluated to determine their effectiveness in developing activity recognition models for excavator-based mastication operations. The ability to automate the classification of cycle elements for operations is valuable for quickly and efficiently quantifying production rates for research and industry applications. The GNSS-RF-based activity recognition model developed successfully classified productive elements versus delay with over 95 per cent accuracy. Individual cycle elements were classified with an overall model accuracy of 73.6 per cent, with individual element classification accuracy ranging from 51.3 per cent for walk/reposition to 95.6 per cent for mastication elements. Reineke’s stand density index, basal area (m2 ha−1) of treated areas and the duration of cycle elements impacted the classification accuracy of the activity recognition model. Impacts of forest stand characteristics on the production rate of mastication treatments were also assessed. Production rates (ha·hr−1) for mastication treatments were affected by the basal area of treated areas. However, the degree to which this would impact operations in practice is minimal.

First, xylem cavitation, stomatal behavior, and hydraulic conductivity were examined in Populus trichocarpa. Cavitation occurred at less negative xylem water potentials in trees from wetter environments (−0.71 to −1.32 MPa) compared to trees from drier environments (−1.55 to −1.67 MPa). Additionally, trees from wetter environments exhibited higher stem hydraulic conductivities and limited stomatal control compared to trees from drier environments. Second, annual stem water contents, ice fractions, and xylem conductivities were monitored in Pinus contorta . Stem ice fractions and liquid water contents were measured using time domain reflectometry (TDR). Ice fractions during the winter varied from 0–75% and liquid water was in the xylem at temperatures <−20°C. Xylem conductivities decreased 70% through the winter and recovered to pre-winter values by May. No reductions in xylem conductivity were, observed during the summer. Third, xylem cavitation and stem water contents were monitored in conifers from upper and lower treeline. Species growing at lower treeline (Larix occidentalis and Pinus contorta) exhibited higher resistances to xylem cavitation (3.29 to 3.61 MPa) compared to species growing at upper treeline (Larix lyallii and Pinus albicaulis, 2.46 to 2.78 MPa). No species experienced losses in stem hydraulic conductivity during the summer. During the winter months, however, lower treeline species experienced 8–15% loss in conductivity compared to >30% for upper treeline species. Loss of stem hydraulic conductivity was correlated to winter freeze-thaw cycles, mid-winter warming and stem water contents in upper treeline species. However, the loss of conductivity was not correlated to environment or to stem water content in lower treeline species.

Many conifers host endophytes that produce important bioactive secondary metabolites. While the endophytes in Pinus ponderosa roots have been studied, the endophyte communities within the needles are not well characterized by molecular means: thus, the goal of this study was to do so. Needles were sampled at two sites located five kilometers apart along a slight precipitation gradient in Eastern Washington State. Fungal DNA (along with pine DNA) was isolated directly from needles of two ages. Internal transcribed spacer regions of the ribosomal RNA gene form fungi were amplified by PCR, cloned, and sequenced. Many of the sequences described have high homology matches in GenBank with known fungi, though most have not previously been directly associated with ponderosa pine. Some sequences were highly homologous with previously published sequences of fungi that have yet to be assigned a taxonomic designation , which suggests some previously undescribed fungi occupy ponderosa pine needles. Despite the proximity of sites, only 18% of the endophytes sequenced were common to both sites. Forty one percent of endophytes were unique to needles from 2012, while 45% of endophytes were unique to needles that emerged in 2014. Although more data from a deep sequencing project will be required to confirm this, the results presented here suggests that fungal endophyte communities in ponderosa pine are fairly diverse geographically, and that communities in the same tree differ depending on the age of the needles.",UIEF; endophytic communities; microbial fungi; needle endophytes; fungal DNA; endophyte sequencing; forest pathology,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,EWU Masters Thesis Collection,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,Access issues,,record,https://dc.ewu.edu/theses/397/,,
uief_0288,The Fate of Chinese Understory Species in Coniferous Forests of the Pacific Northwest: The Role of Light,"Brooke, Molly Muir",2006,Thesis,"An effective method to predict invasive plant species could prevent annually billions of dollars of environmental damage in the U.S. In this study, I propose such a method based on the identification of likely sources of future invaders and factors that could determine the fate of these introductions. Many ornamental species from temperate China may hold a risk of invasion for the Pacific Northwest because of the climatic similarities between temperate coniferous forest regions of China and the Pacific Northwest. Further, these two regions are floristically related and contain many congeneric species that occupy similar ecological niches. Such similarly adapted species could potentially displace their congeners in the introduced range. However, if the non-native species cannot tolerate the shade levels in these forests, they pose no risk of invasion. I experimentally subjected four Chinese understory species, three native congeners for comparison and one bamboo species to two shade levels commonly found in Pacific Northwest forests and monitored their growth rates, leaf morphologies and chlorophyll contents. The Chinese Allium tuberosum demonstrated greater leaf morphology plasticity and relative growth rates than the native A. cernuum but little difference in chlorophyll acclimation. The Chinese Philadelphus kansuensis displayed greater leaf morphology plasticity and more rapid branch elongation than the native P. lewisii but little difference in chlorophyll acclimation. The native Spiraea douglasii appeared light-limited in both shade treatments and the non-native S. japonica and S. wilsonii exhibited no greater abilities to acclimate to shade than the native. The Chinese Fargesia rufa survived and grew in both shade treatments, but the lack of a native bamboo prohibits further comparisons. I predict that A. tuberosum and P. kansuensis are more likely to be able to naturalize in these shade regimes in the Pacific Northwest than are S. japonica or S. wilsonii. The fate of F. rufa in these shade conditions cannot be predicted without further trials. This study illustrates one step in a practical, field-based protocol for evaluating potential plant invaders into intact forest ecosystems where shade may limit invasion success. Horticultural introductions, particularly those from temperate China, may well contribute future plant invaders to the Pacific Northwest.",UIEF; photosynthesis; understory vegetation; invasive plant species; naturalization; competition; light availability; nutrient availability; forest ecology,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,Washington State University,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,https://rex.libraries.wsu.edu/esploro/outputs/graduate/The-fate-of-Chinese-understory-species/99900525155601842,,

Time domain reflectometry (TDR) and frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) are routinely used for rapid, automated and minimally destructive approach for routine measurement of soil water content (θsoil) and stem water content (θstem) in the laboratory and field. Applications and advances of TDR and FDR in soil science have been well-documented, but no attempt has been made to critically review the use of EM methods for measuring θstem. In this paper we review the principles, calibration, sensor configuration, and sensor installation of the TDR and FDR methods for the measurement of θstem. Perspectives are presented on new TDR calibration, the development of new sensors, and technologies for the simultaneous measurement of θstem, sap flow, bulk density/porosity, radial distribution of θstem, and electric conductivity. Also discussed were the effects of tree morphology and wounding on the accuracy of both methods. This review provides information for the novice and expert alike to guide them on the advantages, limitations, development, and application of the EM methods required to improve the reliability and validity of measured values of θstem.",UIEF; electromagnetic water estimation; water potential; stem water; porous media; dialectric permittivity; hydraulic capacitance; drought; calibration curves; forest ecology,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,Science Direct,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,Access issues,,record,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108442,,
uief_0290,"Influence of Limited Water Access on Douglas-fir Seedling Root Systems, Physiology, and Growth","Sheridan, Rebecca A.",2019-04-03,Dissertation,"Nursery-grown seedlings are critical for attaining reforestation and restoration success in many ecosystems, including mixed-conifer forests in the Northwest, which is the native range for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Seedling establishment after planting depends on coordinated responses in seedling growth, physiology, and hydraulic function. The chapters in this dissertation review growth targets for seedling morphology, test methods to describe root growth and function, and evaluate how water limitation and experimental manipulations of seedling root morphology impact root hydraulic function and whole-plant responses of Douglas-fir seedlings. Results show that root hydraulic function changes in response to water limitation due to drying soil, but not in response to water limitation created through removal of portions of the root system. Aboveground physiological functions of seedlings, including photosynthesis and growth, change along with root hydraulic function, as predicted by a conceptual model of seedling establishment. However, the results described within these chapters challenge some of the assumptions about root growth after planting and its role in seedling establishment. Specifically, greater initial root volume did not lead to greater root growth and an increase in root growth was not proportional to increase root hydraulic conductance in water-limiting conditions. From this dissertation, one can conclude that classifying hydraulic characteristics of nursery-grown seedlings and assessing functional responses after planting will help with planning for and troubleshooting reforestation and restoration challenges.",UIEF; reforestation; forest restoration; ecosystem functions; seedling health; photosynthesis; root hydraulic function; seedling establishment; water limitations; silviculture,,UIEF,46.869607,-116.733856,,,,,Oregon State University,"Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences",,,,,"In copyright, educational use permitted.",http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,Text,,en,,,record,https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/5138jm58j,,

However, none of these solutions is complete. Most have strengths that are offset by the technical limitations of their underlying models, assumptions or technologies. None present a comprehensive generalized solution. This situation has created an opportunity to build a more capable and robust solution. The key to such a solution was found through the integration of multiple theories, approaches and concepts. Attempts to utilize these ideas in the past have been applied in industry and research, but none has attempted to integrate them into a comprehensive solution or solve the problems that may arise as a result o f integration.The research is a major step toward providing such a solution.

Monophyly of the native species was tested using mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear (28S, CAD, ArgK) genes and 43 morphological characters in parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. Parsimony analyses of molecular and combined datasets provided mixed results while Bayesian analysis recovered most nodes with posterior probabilities >90%. Native hardwood- and conifer-feeding Scolytus species were recovered as paraphyletic. Native Nearctic species were recovered as paraphyletic with hardwood-feeding species sister to Palearctic hardwood-feeding species rather than to native conifer-feeding species. The Nearctic conifer-feeding species were monophyletic. Twenty-five species were recognized. Four new synonyms were discovered: Scolytus praeceps LeConte, 1868 (= Scolytus abietis Blackman, 1934; = Scolytus opacus Blackman, 1934), Scolytus reflexus Blackman, 1934 (= Scolytus virgatus Bright, 1972; = Scolytus wickhami Blackman, 1934).
