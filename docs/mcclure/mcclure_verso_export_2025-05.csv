Adapting the Women’s empowerment in nutrition index: Lessons from Kenya,"Lentz, Erin; Jensen, Nathan; Lepariyo, Watson; Narayanan, Sudha; Bageant, Elizabeth",2024-12-09,,"Women face a disproportionate burden of malnutrition and food insecurity. Research has shown that women’s empowerment can buffer women against nutritional problems. This paper contributes to ongoing efforts to measure women’s empowerment that are both context-sensitive and universal, focusing on the recently developed Women’s Empowerment in Nutrition Index (WENI). Earlier research has shown it is both a valid construct and positively related to dietary and nutritional outcomes of women in South Asia. We establish that WENI is generalizable to agropastoral and pastoral Kenya, an area with substantially different livelihoods, food system, norms, and institutions than South Asia. We find that a locally contextualized WENI is strongly associated with women’s body mass index and dietary diversity as well as household level food insecurity. We also present findings for two shorter variations of WENI: an abbreviated WENI (A-WENI) and a cross context WENI (CC-WENI). A-WENI contains a small subset of WENI indicators identified using machine learning with South Asian data and therefore is context-specific. CC-WENI does not contain indicators specific to the validation context. We find that they perform comparably well with caveats. Thus, as use of WENI expands we recommend adapting WENI for in-depth analyses of women’s nu",Research Reports,,Elsevier Ltd,Elsevier Ltd,,eng,"In copyright, educational use permitted.

How do women’s empowerment metrics measure up? A comparative analysis,"Bageant, Elizabeth; Lentz, Erin; Narayanan, Sudha; Jensen, Nathan; Lepariyo, Watson",2024-11,,"Research has identified women’s empowerment as a critical factor for nutritional outcomes and a priority area for understanding women’s mental health status. At the same time, there is no consensus on how empowerment should be measured. The surrounding debate has produced several empowerment metrics that are widely used, yet we know little about whether they can be substituted for one another or their respective strengths and weaknesses. Using data collected from a single sample of women from rural, northern Kenya, we compare five empowerment metrics: The Project-level Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (pro-WEAI) and associated Health and Nutrition Module (HN), Women’s Empowerment in Nutrition Index (WENI), Women’s Empowerment in Livestock Index (WELI), and the Survey Based Women’s Empowerment Index (SWPER). The metrics have shared theoretical origins and are commonly used in the food, nutrition and health spaces to study rural women’s lives across low- and middle-income countries. We examine the metrics’ characteristics, distributions, pairwise correlations and capacity of each metric to predict outcomes often associated with the concept of empowerment: body mass index (BMI) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). We find striking differences between these common empowerment me",Research Reports,,Elsevier Ltd,"Food Policy, 129, 102764",DOI: 10.5751/ES-11053-240318,eng,"In copyright, educational use permitted.

Commercially traded fish portfolios mask household utilization of biodiversity in wild food systems,"Fiorella, Kathryn J; Bageant, Elizabeth R; Thilsted, Shakuntala H; Heilpern, Sebastian A",2024-07-23,,"The global biodiversity that underpins wild food systems-including fisheries-is rapidly declining. Yet, we often have only a limited understanding of how households use and benefit from biodiversity in the ecosystems surrounding them. Explicating these relationships is critical to forestall and mitigate the effects of biodiversity declines on food and nutrition security. Here, we quantify how biodiversity filters from ecosystems to household harvest, consumption, and sale, and how ecological traits and household characteristics shape these relationships. We used a unique, integrated ecological (40 sites, quarterly data collection) and household survey (n = 414, every 2 mo data collection) dataset collected over 3 y in rice field fisheries surrounding Cambodia's Tonlé Sap, one of Earth's most productive and diverse freshwater systems. While ecosystem biodiversity was positively associated with household catch, consumption, and sold biodiversity, households consumed an average of 43% of the species present in the ecosystem and sold only 9%. Larger, less nutritious, and more common species were disproportionally represented in portfolios of commercially traded species, while consumed species mirrored catches. The relationship between ecosystem and consumed biodiversity was remarkably consistent across variation in",Research Reports,,,"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences - PNAS, 121, 30, e2403691121",,eng,"In copyright, educational use permitted.

The study aimed to examine how small-scale fishing households, including fishers and fish traders, are responding to COVID-19 and associated movement restrictions around Lake Victoria, Kenya. We conducted phone interviews with 88 households in three riparian communities around Lake Victoria to examine shifts in fish consumption, fishing activities, price changes, and coping strategies. We found that households are consuming less fish, perceiving high fish prices, and coping by more often selling than eating fish. Most fishers and traders reported spending less time fishing and trading, and concern about being infected with COVID-19 was high. Our findings suggest movement restrictions and COVID-19 concern, along with high lake levels in the region, may limit fishing activities and fish access. Controlling COVID-19 and supporting opportunities for fishers and traders to safely return to their livelihood activities will be paramount to the recovery of small-scale fishing communities today. Our findings can also support planning to mitigate the impacts of future crises on small-scale fishing communities.",Research Reports,,Elsevier B.V,"Fisheries Research, 237, 105856",,eng,"In copyright, educational use permitted.

Fishers' response to temperature change reveals the importance of integrating human behavior in climate change analysis,"Fiorella, Kathryn J; Bageant, Liz; Schwartz, Naomi B; Thilsted, Shakuntala H; Barrett, Christopher B",2021-04,,"Climate change will reshape ecological dynamics. Yet, how temperature increases alter the behavior and resource use of people reliant on natural resources remains underexplored. Consequent behavior shifts have the potential to mitigate or accelerate climate impacts on livelihoods and food security. Particularly within the small-scale inland fisheries that support approximately 10% of the global population, temperature changes likely affect both fish and fishers. To analyze how changing temperatures alter households' fishing behavior, we examined fishing effort and fish catch in a major inland fishery. We used longitudinal observational data from households in Cambodia, which has the highest per-capita consumption of inland fish in the world. Higher temperatures caused households to reduce their participation in fishing but had limited net effects on fish catch. Incorporating human behavioral responses to changing environmental conditions will be fundamental to determining how climate change affects rural livelihoods, food production, and food access.",Research Reports,,American Association for the Advancement of Science,"Science Advances, 7, 18",,eng,"In copyright, educational use permitted.

Sensitivity of Idaho Fishes to Climate Change,"Caudill, Christopher; Masingale, Jonathan; Seaborn, Travis; Hora, Dona; Isaak, Daniel",2021,Land,"Climate change is predicted to produce “winners” and “losers” among Idaho's native fishes in terms of kilometers of stream habitat. Habitat quality is predicted to decline in large rivers that support the highest quality fisheries for native natural-origin salmon and trout. Warming is predicted to expand the distributions of three key non-native species (brown trout, brook trout, and smallmouth bass), but expansions may only benefit smallmouth bass anglers in rivers; expansions of trout species will occur in small headwater streams that are rarely fished. The changing climate will affect habitats and species interactions in complex ways beyond the effects of temperature alone. Predictions for anadromous fish species are further complicated by migratory life cycles. Economic impacts will depend on changes in fish distribution; fish traits, such as size and abundance; angler access and activity; feedback patterns between climate effects; changes in socio-ecological drivers; climate mitigation actions (e.g., riparian management, instream flow regulation); and economic costs and benefits of conservation and management action, including Endangered Species Act (ESA) listings.",Idaho Climate-Economy Impacts Assessment,,"James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research, University of Idaho",Idaho Climate-Economy Impacts Assessment,,eng,"In copyright, educational use permitted.

Ecosystems and Species Report,"Carr, Kaylee; Hicke, Jeffrey",2021,Land,"Idaho's ecosystems can be characterized in different ways, including a) resilience, a measure of human modification, diversity of microclimates, and ecological representativeness; b) connectivity and climate flow; and c) biodiversity value. Much of Idaho is considered resilient, with ecosystems that are connected, allow movement of species, and recognized for biodiversity value. Agricultural and urban areas in northern and southern Idaho are designated least resilient, less connected, and of less significance in terms of biodiversity value. Areas of biodiversity value within Idaho do not always overlap areas of climate resilience, which means adaptation options will help support and facilitate continued biodiversity. Most ecosystems are addressed elsewhere in the assessment; here we cover alpine ecosystems (i.e., locations above treeline). Climate change is expected to facilitate upward movement of treeline, thereby reducing alpine area. Some evidence for this upslope movement exists, but in some areas, movement is slower than predicted. Many Idaho species are covered in other assessment reports.

Forests Technical Report,"Hicke, Jeffrey; Latta, Greg",2021,Land,"The forests of Idaho have long played a fundamental role for inhabitants. They have provided shelter; sustenance; jobs in silviculture, logging, and manufacturing; the land base upon which homes and structures have been built; and areas for hunting and recreation. Decades of wildfire suppression coupled with federal forest policy changes in the 1990s have created forest conditions susceptible to increased risk of wildfire, insects, and disease, exacerbated by an increasingly warm and dry climate. The increased risks, and various ownerships' responses to increased risk, have important impacts on the state's forest resources and economy. To understand the potential economic risks to Idaho forests from climate change, it is necessary to understand the underlying resource base and ownership structure. This report first takes a brief look at the forest land base and resource characteristics, and how they have changed in the recent past. It then presents the contributions to Idaho's economy through timber harvesting and forest products manufacturing. After that, the report identifies how forests are affected by climate change, and provides an overview of studies that explore climate change impacts. The final section lays out mitigation and adaption options.",Idaho Climate-Economy Impacts Assessment,,"James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research, University of Idaho",Idaho Climate-Economy Impacts Assessment,,eng,"In copyright, educational use permitted.

Examining Collaboration within U.S. National Park Service Advisory Committees,"Foster, Megan",2020,"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism; Social Sciences; Social Sciences - Other Topics","This study develops an evaluative tool for assessing collaboration within U.S. National Park Service (NPS) Federal Advisory Committees. Advisory committees are one of the mechanisms the NPS uses for active community participation. However, questions concerning the effective use of advisory committees have arisen in recent years, and because of this, a mass review of these committees, ordered by the Trump Administration, has led to questions about the efficacy and success of advisory committees. While a traditional metric that is used to judge success of these committees is the percent of recommendations that are implemented by the NPS, this metric does not recognize the synergistic benefits these forums provide for interaction, discussion, and collaboration. Drawing on an index of nine indicators that are extracted from the body of literature on collaborative governance, such as leadership and openness, a novel tool was created to measure collaboration within advisory committees. Through an analysis of committee meeting minutes spanning six cases, this paper fords that advisory committees tend to be collaborative and demonstrate that these committees are more than just a veil of participation or simply filling a required part of the public participation process. Committees were also found to play a valuable part",Research Reports,,SAGAMORE PUBLISHING LLC,"Journal of park and recreation administration, 38, 4, 75-89",,eng,"In copyright, educational use permitted.

We analyzed the content of 216 meeting minutes and 18 policy documents for 13 municipalities in New York. Our observations suggest that government responsiveness to local activism is shaped by the level of contestation between grassroots stakeholders. They reveal that contestation among grassroots stakeholders encourages LEOs to try to deflect responsibility for regulating fracking. When this contestation is high, LEOs tend to pursue actions which may limit but not prohibit HVHF within their jurisdiction. In contrast, when there is no contestation, LEOs more actively pursue substantive policy actions that prohibit HVHF. Generally, we find that that the level of contestation among grassroots stakeholders about HVHF impacts the political actions LEOs take.",Research Reports,,Springer US,"Policy sciences, 52, 4, 549, 549-571",,eng,"In copyright, educational use permitted.

Our secondary aim is to take advantage of fixed-effects regression models, a rigorous approach that is common in other disciplines, yet novel to analysis of social-ecological system productivity, and allows comparison of each site to itself across time using observational data. We analyze the relative associations of site characteristics, annual fluctuations, biophysical modifications (e.g., deepening, creation of inlet/outlets, etc.), and governance capacity (i.e., community committee meeting intensity, fundraising to support illegal fishing patrols, etc.) with fish biomass and biodiversity within 40 refuges over three years.

These diverse fisheries support the livelihoods and the food and nutrition security of millions of Cambodian people. However, these fisheries also face a range of threats, including conflicts with dam projects that disrupt fish movement and spawning, increasing harvest pressure, and unpredictable flood seasons. Rice -field fisheries support as much as 30% of all fish catch in Cambodia and are the site of a unique management strategy that has been implemented to sustainably improve fish catch and strengthen community governance: community fish refuges (CFRs). Community fish refuges have been encouraged by the government of Cambodia and are community -managed protected areas designed to increase fish productivity and protect biodiversity. We use governance scores to examine how support for CFRs from 2012 to 2015 has improved their governance across five dimensions (structure, planning, representation, fundraising, and networking) and the relationship between governance and fish biomass within CFRs. We find some associations between the governance scores and the biomass and biodiversity of the refuges, suggesting that improving governance may affect fishery productivity in this setting.

Effects of climate variability on freshwater fisheries in Cambodia's rice field fisheries: a longitudinal cohort study,"Fiorella, Kathryn J; Bageant, Elizabeth R; Ordonez, Karina Acosta; Kim, Miratori; Kura, Yumiko; Thilsted, Shakuntala H; Barrett, Christopher B",2018-05,,"Projections suggest that by 2050, climate change will reduce global fish catch by 3–13%, with fish catch falling by as much as 30% in some tropical marine systems. Freshwater fisheries are particularly susceptible to the warming effects of climate change because shallower, hydrologically distinct water bodies are easily affected by atmospheric temperatures and less easily accommodate fish migrations. Damage to freshwater fisheries is a problem particularly for poor and undernourished human populations, which are especially dependent on them. Despite the severity of projected climate change effects on fish catch and the risk to human health, few empirical studies have examined how fish catch is already responding to climate variability, the ways fishers are adapting to these changes, and how it affects people's consumption of fish, which are rich in micronutrients and fatty acids. We aim here to account for behavioural responses among fishers to identify the ecological effect of flood and weather on fish catch in Cambodian rice field fisheries, and patterns of fish consumption and nutrition in the local communities. In this longitudinal cohort study, we use a panel dataset collected by WorldFish of 400 households dependent on rice field fisheries over 3 years (19 distinct timepoints) to examine how changing flood",Research Reports,,Elsevier Ltd,Elsevier Ltd,,eng,"In copyright, educational use permitted.

These educators gathered for a three-day Idaho's Future Initiative (IFI) meeting in Boise, examined the student pipeline from eighth grade through the first postsecondary year, and drafted nine recommendations to present to the State Board. Educators at this invitation-only event represented every region of the state, every size of high school, and every one of the state's eight public colleges and universities.

Community Impacts of Idaho's Dairy Workforce,"Salant, Priscilla; Wulfhorst, J.D.; Cruz, Erinn; Dearien, Christine",2017,,"This study updates our 2009 analysis of how the dairy industry's workforce impacts communities in Idaho's south central region, commonly referred to as the Magic Valley. The region is home to about 70 percent of Idaho's dairy cows and 10 percent of its residents. In the original study and in the update, we examine community impacts from a demographic, economic, and social perspective. Both studies were funded by grants from the Idaho Dairymen's Association. For the 2017 study, we conducted 48 semi-structured interviews with experts and keyinformants selected based on their knowledge of the region, its communities, and the dairy industry. In addition to our interviews, we also analyzed secondary data from federal, state, and local sources. These data provide important context to help understand themes, trends, and patterns that emerge from qualitative interviews, and vice versa. Two key national trends form the context for this report. The first is a continuation of decadeslong structural change in the dairy industry, towards fewer and larger farms. The second is slowing growth in the Hispanic population, largely the result of lower birth rates (in both Mexico and the U.S.) and a dramatic decline in the number of Mexican immigrants entering the U.S.",Research Reports,,"James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research, University of Idaho",Research Reports,,eng,"In copyright, educational use permitted.

Towards Food Security in Idaho,"Salant, Priscilla; Dearien, Christine; Cruz, Erinn",2014,,"Food insecurity causes serious long-term problems for individuals and society as a whole. People with poor diets are far more likely to experience poor overall health status, activity-limiting health impairments, depression and other mental health issues. Children with poor diets experience compromised health and development and are less likely to succeed in school, while adults who experienced childhood hunger are more likely to miss work and have a harder time holding down a job. People with poor diets are also more vulnerable to being overweight and obese. They have lower incomes, less access to affordable, healthy foods, and fewer options for physical activity. We have two goals in writing this report. First, we aim to create a base of common information about Idaho's food security challenge and how it is currently being addressed. Second, we seek to encourage organizations and agencies to collaborate around a common agenda to improve food security in Idaho. In achieving these goals, we also aim to identify the best ways in which the University of Idaho can work with partners to address Idaho's food security challenge.",Research Reports,,"James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research, University of Idaho",Research Reports,,eng,"In copyright, educational use permitted.

Two parallel trends shape the context for this analysis. Both are consistent with national trends in farm-dependent areas of the country. First, the structure of Idaho's dairy industry is changing. The trend is towards larger and more geographically concentrated farms with an increasing demand for wage labor. Second, Idaho is becoming more ethnically diverse as the state's Hispanic population grows at a faster rate than the rest of the population.",Research Reports,,"James A. & Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research, University of Idaho",Research Reports,,eng,"In copyright, educational use permitted.
