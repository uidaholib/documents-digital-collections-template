## About Latah County Historical Society

The [Latah County Historical Society's](https://www.latahcountyhistoricalsociety.org/) origins go back to 1891, just 20 years after the first settlers had arrived in the area, when fourteen of those settlers founded the Latah County Pioneer Association. This new organization aimed to "promote community sociability and progress, and to preserve treasured pioneer-day relics."[^1]

Just a few years later, in 1895, a group of Moscow women established the Moscow Historical Club. As one of their many civic engagement projects, MHC worked alongside the Pioneer Association to preserve Moscow's McConnell Mansion as a historic museum.[^1] The [McConnell Mansion Historic House Museum](https://www.latahcountyhistoricalsociety.org/museum) is still maintained by the Historical Society today. 

During its many years working to preserve county history, the Latah County Pioneer Association went through a series of name changes. Finally, in 1978, members selected the name Latah County Historical Society. This change reflected the organization's "wider scope of activities in preserving, sharing and celebrating the history of Latah County, in addition to its goal of finding a way to display artifacts telling the areaâ€™s history."[^2]

## About the Collection

The Latah Legacy began in 1972 as a quarterly bulletin put out by what was then named the Latah County Pioneer Historical Museum Association.

Although the first quarterly bulletin consisted mainly of news and updates relating to the organization, the bulletin soon began to regularly include historical narratives, photographs, and reviews of books related to Latah County history. 

By 1980, the quarterly newsletter had become a full-fledged journal of local history, the Latah Legacy.

The issues in this collection, which span from 1972 - 2023, contain historical materials which primarily explore the settler history of Latah County. A newsletter which lists notices of upcoming Historical Society events and organizational updates is also occasionally included with the journal.

Print copies of this publication are also held in [Special Collections and Archives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/) at the University of Idaho Library.

## Related Collection: Latah County Oral History Collection

The [Latah County Oral History Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/lcoh/) is the result of a collaboration between the University of Idaho Library and the Latah County Historical Society. 

In the mid-1970s, LCHS conducted and recorded over 300 interviews with people who had lived in Latah County at the beginning of the twentieth century. As you read through the Latah Legacy collection, you will find frequent mention of the process and impact of this project, as well as some transcriptions of interviews. 

In 2015, LCHS and the U of I Library digitized the recordings and created the digital collection, which allows the public to more easily access and interact with some of Latah County's oral history.
