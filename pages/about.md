Founded with the mission of amplifying student voices in the field of political science, the journal encourages emerging scholars to explore diverse political topics, ranging from international relations and public policy to comparative politics. By providing a peer-reviewed outlet for undergraduate research, the journal not only enhances the academic experience for students but also contributes to the broader discourse in political science.
