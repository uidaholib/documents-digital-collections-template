## About the Latah Legacy

{% include feature/blockquote.html quote="The Latah Legacy explores past and contemporary events, people, or topics with a connection to Latah County. Additionally, the journal serves as a way for amateur and professional scholars to submit research that may not have previously been told. The publication documents these stories for current and future generations to learn about the local community.
 
The Latah Legacy began publication in 1972 by the Latah County Historical Society. Originally published quarterly, the Latah Legacy is now published once a year. The publication serves as the local historical journal for Latah County and is authored by various community members." speaker="Kaitlynn Anderson, Museum Curator"%}

## About Latah County Historical Society

The [Latah County Historical Society's](https://www.latahcountyhistoricalsociety.org/) origins go back to 1891, just 20 years after the first settlers had arrived in the area, when fourteen of those settlers founded the Latah County Pioneer Association. This new organization aimed to "promote community sociability and progress, and to preserve treasured pioneer-day relics."[^1]

Just a few years later, in 1895, a group of Moscow women established the Moscow Historical Club. As one of their many civic engagement projects, MHC worked alongside the Pioneer Association to preserve Moscow's McConnell Mansion as a historic museum.[^1] The [McConnell Mansion Historic House Museum](https://www.latahcountyhistoricalsociety.org/museum) is still maintained by the Historical Society today. 

During its many years working to preserve county history, the Latah County Pioneer Association went through a series of name changes. Finally, in 1978, members selected the name Latah County Historical Society. This change reflected the organization's "wider scope of activities in preserving, sharing and celebrating the history of Latah County, in addition to its goal of finding a way to display artifacts telling the areaâ€™s history."[^2]

## About the Collection

This collection contains digitized issues of the Latah Legacy, beginning with the first issue which was circulated in 1972. 

This first issue was a quarterly bulletin which announced that it would be the first of many such bulletins put out by the organization.

Since 1972, issues have included materials such as: [book reviews](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/latahlegacy/items/latahlegacy_v05-n2.html), [oral history transcripts](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/latahlegacy/items/latahlegacy_v28-n2.html), [poetry](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/latahlegacy/items/latahlegacy_v49-n1.html), [family histories](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/latahlegacy/items/latahlegacy_v29.html), and [historical photographs](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/latahlegacy/items/latahlegacy_v19-n1.html). In the 1980s, the Legacy even serially published the [memoirs of Alma Lauder-Keeling](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/latahlegacy/items/latahlegacy_v12-n2.html), a second-generation Moscow pioneer. 

Much of the Legacy has focused on the settler history of the Latah County area. Many of the [earlier issues](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/latahlegacy/items/latahlegacy_v04-n3.html) in particular contain a good deal of information concerning the early settlement and development of the region, often presented through settler diaries, oral histories, and family stories. 

Some later Legacy articles seek to address gaps in the published history of the region. For example, in [the Fall 1990 issue](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/latahlegacy/items/latahlegacy_v19-n1.html), Mary Reed examines some of the reasons many pioneer-era businesses operated by Chinese immigrants have likely been left out of historical records.  

Many Latah Legacy articles also reference contemporary events with relevance to local history. For example, the [2023 issue](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/latahlegacy/items/latahlegacy_v50-n1.html) includes an showcasing the archaeological dig at Moscow High School which was conducted by the University of Idaho in Fall 2023.

This collection will continue to be updated to include the most recent issues of the Latah Legacy as they are published.

Print copies of this publication are also held in [Special Collections and Archives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/) at the University of Idaho Library.

## Related Collection: Latah County Oral History Collection

The [Latah County Oral History Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/lcoh/) is the result of a collaboration between the University of Idaho Library and the Latah County Historical Society. 

In the mid-1970s, LCHS conducted and recorded over 300 interviews with people who had lived in Latah County at the beginning of the twentieth century. As you read through the Latah Legacy collection, you will find frequent mention of the process and impact of this project, as well as some transcriptions of interviews. 

In 2015, LCHS and the U of I Library digitized the recordings and created the digital collection, which allows the public to more easily access and interact with some of Latah County's oral history.
