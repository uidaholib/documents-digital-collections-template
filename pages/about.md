## About The Idaho Bach Festival

The Idaho Bach Festival is a community event celebrating the work of Johann Sebastian Bach and other composers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in performances by University of Idaho's Lionel Hampton School of Music faculty and students, and guest artists from other universities in the region.

The festival was founded in 2011 by Michael Murphy, director of choral studies at the Lionel Hampton School of Music. 
It is now co-directed by cello professor Miranda Wilson and voice professors Christopher Pfund and Lynette Pfund.
