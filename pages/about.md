## University of Idaho Experimental Forest Research Exchange 

The [University of Idaho Experimental Forest (UIEF)](https://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/ui-experimental-forest) is Idaho's working research, teaching, and demonstration forest.
The UIEF Research Exchange is a living database that provides access to UIEF research and related content to help inspire scientific inquiry and inform forestry and natural resource management.

The UIEF Research Exchange brings together items from a variety of sources including publications, theses and dissertations, presentations, and other research products.
Additionally, the archive curates content of historical interest including popular press articles and outreach materials that may be useful for informing research and teaching.

In some cases, preview items include partially digitized files and detailed geospatial information. 
Research items are also georeferenced on the [collection map]({{ '/map.html' | relative_url }}).

The Research Exchange is a living repository. 
All research products from current studies making use of the UIEF or UIEF data products must be submitted to the archive.
Please use our submission form to add a record of your research:

## About the Collection

The core of the collection grew from a 2004 effort by UIEF staff to compile prior peer-reviewed publications, theses, and dissertations available at that time. 
Additional data from 2004-present were collected in 2022 using UIEF's internal paper and digital archives, search engines, and related University of Idaho Library digital collections.

The initial collection information was organized and described by Kelsey Roach (UIEF) and Axel Wall (UIEF).
The site was developed by Evan Williamson (Library), Robert Keefe (UIEF), and Jeremy Kenyon (Library).
