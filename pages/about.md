This digital collection consists of 137 Camas Prairie Railroad time table documents ranging in date from 1909 to 1997, and including time tables intended for employee use as well as special notices. Each time table includes the train schedule, as well as general and special instructions.

## About the Camas Prairie Railroad

The Camas Prairie Railroad Company was created when the Northern Pacific Railway and Union Pacific agreed to form and equally share a third company. [^1]

The Camas Prairie Railroad (CPR) began operation on December 3, 1909 and remained in operation for 92 years. It was headquartered in Lewiston and would span 267.7 miles. 

While the railroad offered some passenger service[^2], it was primarily used as a freight line for products such as lumber, ore, and agricultural products. Companies like the [Craig Mountain Lumber Company](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/craigmountain/), began transferring lumber through the CPR in 1910. [^1]

The CPR was sold to North American Railnet in 1997. In 2004, it was sold to Watco Companies LLC and renamed the Great Northwest Railroad. [^2]

The Camas Prairie Railroad's main subdivision routes were:
- Lewiston, ID to Riparia, WA
- Lewiston, ID to Stites, ID
- Spalding, ID to Grangeville, ID
- Orofino, ID to Headquarters, ID
