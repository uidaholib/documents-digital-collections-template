## About The Blot Archive

The Blot Magazine Archive collection provides access to past issues of the [Blot Magazine](https://www.blotmagazine.com/), a student run publication at the University of Idaho.

The Blot began in 1946 as a part of the [University of Idaho Student Media Department](https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/student-involvement/student-media), alongside the [Argonaut newspaper](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/argonaut/) and the [Gem of the Mountains yearbook](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/gem/). Originally the campus humor and literary magazine, Blot was discontinued during the 1950s due to a lack of funds. 

After a long hiatus, the Blot resumed production in 2004 as a quarterly print publication, completely produced from start to finish by University of Idaho students.
The magazine publishes a variety of writing, hoping to provide a contemporary perspective on students and their experiences.

The Blot Magazine Archive currently contains 21 issues from 1946 to 1951 and 64 issues from 2005 to 2021. 
Early editions were digitized by U of I Library from print copies held in [Special Collections and Archives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/).
Since 2010 PDFs were created by Blot staff and originally published on ISSUU to provide digital access in addition to their print magazine.
