## About the Collection

Owned and operated by Northern Pacific Railway and Union Pacific, the Camas Prairie Railroad ran through northern Idaho from roughly 1909 to the late 1990s. 

This digital collection consists of 137 Camas Prairie Railroad time table documents ranging in date from 1909 to 1997, and including time tables intended for employee use as well as special notices. Each time table includes the train schedule, as well as general and special instructions.

The Camas Prairie Railroad's main subdivision routes were:
- Lewiston, ID to Riparia, WA
- Lewiston, ID to Stites, ID
- Spalding, ID to Grangeville, ID
- Orofino, ID to Headquarters, ID

The documents in this collection were donated to the University of Idaho Special Collections and Archives by the Northern Pacific Railway Historical Association.
