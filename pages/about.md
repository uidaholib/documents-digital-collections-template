## About Martin Journal ArchiveMartin Journal Archive

This repository collects past issues of the The Journal of the Martin Institute | International Studies, which is published by the Martin Institute at University of Idaho. 

From their website:

"The Journal of the Martin Institute | International Studies began in 2009 as a venue to feature top student research within the Martin Institute. Students in the Martin Academy and Martin Scholars programs and the International Studies capstone course who produced particularly noteworthy research were invited to submit their papers to a team of student co-editors, Chad Mann and Alexis Olson, who evaluated the submissions and selected the best for publication.

Future volumes will include one to two issues annually, one featuring articles written exclusively by students in International Studies, and the other comprised of articles written by students elsewhere on campus. The Martin Institute | Program in International Studies publishes both a print and online version of the journal."
