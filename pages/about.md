## About Latah County Historical Society

The [Latah County Historical Society's](https://www.latahcountyhistoricalsociety.org/) origins go back to 1891, when a group of fourteen Latah County community members founded the Latah County Pioneer Association just 20 years after the first settlers had arrived in the area (Latah Legacy, Vol. 17, No. 3).

Just a few years later, in 1895, a group of Moscow women formed the Moscow Historical Club, which would eventually merge with the Latah County Pioneer Association to form the Latah County Pioneer Historical Museum Association. 

The LCMPHA would change its name to the Latah County Museum Society in 1973, then to the Latah County Historical Society in 1978. This final name change reflected the organization's "wider scope of activities in preserving, sharing and celebrating the history of Latah County, in addition to its goal of finding a way to display artifacts telling the areaâ€™s history." (Latah Legacy Vol. 45, No. 1)



## About the Collection

The Latah Legacy began in 1972 as a quarterly bulletin put out by Latah County Pioneer Historical Museum Association.

Although the first quarterly bulletin consisted primarily of news and updates relating to the organization, the bulletin soon began to regularly include historical narratives, photographs, and reviews of books related to Latah County history. 

By 1980, the quarterly newsletter had become a full-fledged journal of local history, the Latah Legacy.

The issues in this collection, which span from 1972 - 2023, contain historical materials which explore the settler history of Latah County. A newsletter which lists notices of upcoming Historical Society events and organizational updates is also occasionally included with the journal.

Print copies of this publication are also held in [Special Collections and Archives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/) at the University of Idaho Library.


## Related Collection: Latah County Oral History Collection

The [Latah County Oral History Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/lcoh/) is the result of a collaboration between the University of Idaho Library and the Latah County Historical Society. 

In the mid-1970s, LCHS conducted and recorded over 300 interviews with people who had lived in Latah County at the beginning of the twentieth century. As you read through the Latah Legacy collection, you will find frequent mention of the process and impact of this project, as well as some transcriptions of interviews. 

In 2015, LCHS and the U of I Library digitized the recordings and created a digital collection, which allows the public to more easily access and interact with some of Latah County's oral history.
