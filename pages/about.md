## About the McClure Center Archive

The McClure Center Archive brings together the publications of the University of Idaho’s [James A. and Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research](https://www.uidaho.edu/president/direct-reports/mcclure-center) for long-term open access.
The Center regularly publishes new materials on their website, in hard copy, and the [VERSO repository](https://verso.uidaho.edu/esploro/search/outputs?unit=01ALLIANCE_UID___n248278&page=1&institution=01ALLIANCE_UID&sort=date_d).
The items are transferred to the University of Idaho Library for preservation and are added to this digital collection on an annual basis.

Since 2007, the McClure Center has directly supported public policy research and collaboration in Idaho by facilitating public discourse, publishing research, and engaging students around public policy making.
