## About the Journal of the Martin Institute
From its foundation in 1979, the [Martin Institute](https://www.uidaho.edu/class/martin-institute) has emphasized well-informed, deeply researched, and cogent solutions to complex global issues. The establishment of a namesake journal in 2009 allowed the Institute to share its research with a wider audience, while the focus on undergraduate researchers showcased their insight and talent. This product of the deep and unique mentoring afforded undergraduates by the Institute continues to resonate in our ever-evolving world.

This repository collects past issues of the *Journal of the Martin Institute \| International Studies*, which is published by the Martin Institute at University of Idaho. The journal was previously titled *Journal of the Martin School \| International Studies* (2011-2012) and *Journal of the Martin School of International Studies* (2009-2010), from when the Institute also oversaw a school within the College of Letters, Arts, and Social Sciences. 

The current styling of the title, which includes a vertical line separating Martin Institute and International Studies, envisions a time when additional volumes focused on other disciplines could be published.

## Research in the Martin Journal
Papers published in the journal take one of two forms: a white paper or a policy paper.  White papers are written as part of the capstone class in the International Studies degree program, and are documents demonstrating the breadth of one's analysis of an issue. They are designed to show people how a proposed solution to a problem stacks up against other approaches. They differ from a policy paper in terms of breadth: white papers consider all possible solutions to a topic while policy papers focus on a handful of options. Policy papers are written as part of the [Martin Scholars](https://www.uidaho.edu/class/martin-institute/research/martin-scholars) and [Martin Academy](https://www.uidaho.edu/class/martin-institute/research/academy) programs, and are designed to suggest policy options for a current problem/issue. They attempt to convince policymakers that the author's recommendation is worth pursuing.

In addition to these, interviews with visiting ambassadors and the top position paper written as part of the Martin Institute's delegation to the [National Model United Nations](https://www.nmun.org/) Conference are regularly included in the journal.

## Editorial Process
Each issue is edited by a pair of rising seniors who have reached an advanced point in their studies but who are not part of the capstone, the Martin Scholars, or the Martin Academy that year in order to maintain blind peer review of candidate papers. Each set of co-editors makes their own rubric by which to evaluate papers, reviews each candidate paper separately and jointly, organizes the journal, and writes an introductory letter for that issue.
