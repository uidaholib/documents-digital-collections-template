## About the Collection

The Idaho Waters Digital Library (IWDL) provides open digital access to unique information resources relating to water issues in key Idaho river basins.
Making up the core of the collection are more than 700 scientific and technical reports produced by [Idaho Water Resources Research Institute](https://iwrri.uidaho.edu/) (IWRRI) researchers between 1963 and 2014, digitized by University of Idaho Library.
IWDL supports ongoing research and understanding of the region while preserving an era of previous work and research investment.

## Background

A significant amount of unique research publications related to Idaho water resources remain difficult to discover and access, existing in print copies only with limited availability to researchers and the public.
To address this issue, the IWDL has been developed and managed at the University of Idaho Library since 2008, when Jodi Haire laid the foundation as a graduate project.
Her work was influential in jump starting the Digital Collections program at the library, representing its first large document collection hosted online.

The IWDL was greatly enhanced and expanded by funding from the [United States Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/) administered by IWRRI in 2012 and 2017. 
Each phase of development brought more digitized documents, quality metadata, and web interface improvements that ensure usability and discoverability of the collection.
This funding helped solidify the IWDL, supporting a wealth of content and technical enhancements that add value for researchers, scholars, and other stakeholders.

More than 700 documents are currently accessible, representing over 550 critical subject areas, such as mine wastes, water policy, hydroelectric power, and aquifer management. 
IWDL serves as a repository to facilitate research on Idaho watersheds, enabling better discovery, access, and dissemination, while ensuring digital preservation of the materials.

## Acknowledgements

This project would not have been possible without the grant support of the [United States Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/) and the [Idaho Water Resources Research Institute](https://iwrri.uidaho.edu/), the metadata and digitization work of Warren Bromley-Vogel and Karen Trebitz, and the ground work and efforts of Jodi Haire.
