## About The Idaho Bach Festival

The [Idaho Bach Festival](https://www.uidaho.edu/class/music/events/bach-festival) is a community event celebrating the work of Johann Sebastian Bach and other composers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in performances by University of Idaho's [Lionel Hampton School of Music](https://www.uidaho.edu/class/music) faculty and students, and guest artists from other universities in the region.

It is now co-directed by cello professor Miranda Wilson and voice professors Christopher Pfund and Lynette Pfund.
