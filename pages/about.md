## CONTENTdm Migration Reference

University of Idaho used the CONTENTdm repository system from 2012 to 2023 to host the majority of digital collection items behind the scenes.
Although our main collection interface did not directly feature CONTENTdm, the platform is where full text and cross collection search happened.

If you have old reference urls pointing to our CONTENTdm instance which was hosted at `digital.lib.uidaho.edu` or `cdm17254.contentdm.oclc.org`, those links are now broken.

CONTENTdm reference links followed a pattern that included a collection alias and an item id: 

`digital.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm/ref/collection/< collectionid >/id/< item id >`

The links had several variations, as seen in these examples:

- http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm/ref/collection/whitepine/id/262
- https://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/collection/bar-stock/id/2358
- http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/forester/id/68
- http://cdm17254.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/agecon/id/0

If you are searching for a specific CONTENTdm reference link you can use the collection alias and item id to find the new location using the table or search functions of this site.
