## About the McClure Center Archive

This digital collection brings together the publications of the University of Idaho’s [James A. and Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research](https://www.uidaho.edu/president/direct-reports/mcclure-center). 
These items are published on the McClure Center's website and generally in hard copy. 
The PDFs are transferred to the University of Idaho Library for preservation and long-term access.

The McClure Center was launched in 2007 and is Idaho's trusted center for public policy research and collaboration. 
The McClure Center produces independent, neutral research with integrity. 
Since its doors opened, the McClure Center has heightened public discourse around policy making, published evidence-based research that contributes to a strong democracy, engaged students in learning about public policy making and championed a collaborative approach to tough problems.

A champion for state water rights and a nationally recognized leader in energy and natural resource policy, U.S. Senator Jim McClure earned the respect of his colleagues for his thoughtful pursuit and promotion of bipartisan collaboration leading to the enactment and execution of sound public policy. 
Louise McClure was admired for her leadership, commitment to public service, intellect and grace. 
The McClure Center's collaborative and interdisciplinary approach to addressing society’s complex challenges sustains their remarkable legacy.
