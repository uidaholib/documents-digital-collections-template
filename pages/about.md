## About CollectionBuilder CSV

The undergraduate research journal in political science serves as a vibrant platform for students to publish their original research, which fosters a community of scholarly inquiry and intellectual exchange. Founded with the mission of amplifying student voices in the field of political science, the journal encourages emerging scholars to explore diverse political topics, ranging from international relations and public policy to comparative politics. By providing a peer-reviewed outlet for undergraduate research, the journal not only enhances the academic experience for students but also contributes to the broader discourse in political science.

The editorial board, composed entirely of undergraduate students, plays a crucial role in shaping the journal's vision and policies. This student-led initiative empowers future leaders in academia, allowing them to develop editorial skills and gain hands-on experience in the publication process. The board oversees all aspects of the journal, from the submission and review process to the policies that promote inclusivity and academic integrity, ensuring that the highest standards of research are upheld. Through this collaborative effort, the journal not only highlights the talent and creativity of undergraduate researchers but also nurtures a culture of scholarship that will benefit the political science community for years to come.
