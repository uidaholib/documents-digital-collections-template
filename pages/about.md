## About the Agricultural Economics Research Series

The Agricultural Economics Research Series is a collection of reports and working papers produced by researchers in Agricultural Economics at University of Idaho dating back to the 1950's. It represents a significant effort to study and improve Idaho's economy through a focus on agriculture. 

Around 2017, these materials were identified as valuable documents that were undigitized and difficult to access or discover. 
Through the efforts of librarian Beth Hendrix, the U of I Library consulted with the [Department of Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology](https://www.uidaho.edu/agricultural-life-sciences/academics/agricultural-economics-rural-sociology) to curate the collection and uncover additional documents kept only in the department. 
The documents were digitized by Library staff in the Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL). 

The metadata has also been shared with [AgEcon Search](https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/search?ln=en&as=1&rm=&sf=&so=d&rg=10&c=249&of=hb&as_query=) at the University of Minnesota to promote its cross-institutional Agricultural Economics search engine.
